S protein, a highly N-glycosylated protein of approximately 180 kDa, has been the most widely studied target in SARS-CoV-2.64 The cryo-electron microscopic structure of S protein exists as a homotrimer in the virion envelope, which contains two functional subunits: membrane-distal S1 and membrane-proximal S2 subunits.11,12 The former is composed of N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD, whereas the latter comprises fusion peptide, connector domain (CD), a helix–turn–helix structure formed by heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) around a central helix, transmembrane domain (TM), and CT.65 The noncovalent bind form of S1 and S2 usually presents in several CoVs before fusion.66–70 S1 subunit exerts its effects on recognizing and binding protein-based receptors primarily via RBD.71 Thus, the RBD of S protein exerts its effects on binding ACE2 specifically, which is a significant target for antiviral drugs and vaccines.72–74 Additionally, NTD is reported to be involved in sugar-based receptor binding, virus attachment, and the S protein transition in pre- or post-fusion.75 S2 subunits are responsible for mediating cellular and virus–membrane fusion.",PMC8390046
