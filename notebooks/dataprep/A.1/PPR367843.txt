The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents an unprecedented global crisis necessitating novel approaches for, amongst others, early detection of emerging variants relating to the evolution and spread of the virus. Recently, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater has emerged as a useful tool to monitor the prevalence of the virus in the community. Here, we propose a novel methodology, called 
lineagespot
, for the monitoring of variants and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in wastewater samples using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our proposed method was tested and evaluated using NGS data produced by the sequencing of fourteen wastewater samples from the municipality of Thessaloniki, Greece, covering a six month period. The results showed a clear identification of trends in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in wastewater data. Lineagespot was able to record the evolution and rapid domination of the B.1.1.7 lineage in the community, and allowed for a robust inference between the variants evident through our approach and the variants observed in patients from the same area time periods. Lineagespot is an open-source tool, implemented in R, and is freely available on

Nearly a year after the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread at an unprecedented pace causing a global pandemic. As the main transmission process of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is through droplets and the contact between people, several testing strategies identify whether a person is infected and, in cases of a positive sample, which the underlying virus variant is. However, these methods are not easily scalable, especially in large urban areas, were a high number of individuals have to be tested to assess virus and variant spread among the population. Interestingly, the viral RNA can also be detected in wastewater, with SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in wastewater correlating with the COVID-19 epidemiology
1–3
. Indeed, in the previous work of Petala et al
3
. normalized viral copy levels in Thessaloniki wastewater agreed with the epidemiological conditions in the city. Thessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece with around 1 million inhabitants. The city is a chief gateway for entrepreneurs, traders, university students and tourists visiting Greece and, as such, it was the place where the Greek patient “zero” appeared in March 2020 as well as the so-called South African mutation for the first time. In other words, the city of Thessaloniki is a suitable place as a case study for identifying new variants in the city wastewater before scattering to the rest of the country..

The presence of SARS CoV-2 RNA in wastewater provides us with a unique opportunity, i.e., to identify the most prevalent virus lineages through the analysis of the traces evident in wastewater samples. So far, although there are few studies exploring the SARS-CoV-2 diversity in wastewater, it still remains an open issue as there are no widely accepted methods that can sufficient address this. The most common used approaches involve the sequencing of the wastewater samples, and the consequent application of low frequency variant analysis methods

 or metagenomic approaches
5,6
. In either case, the interpretation of the results focuses on the detection of specific variants
4
 or lineages

 such as B.1.1.7 and 501.V2, prevalent clades
6
 (19A, 20A and 20B) or new uncharacterized mutations

..

In this work we propose a novel methodology called 
lineagespot
, implemented as a software tool that can facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in wastewater samples using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The method is tested and validated across fourteen municipal wastewater samples retrieved in Thessaloniki, Greece in fourteen different time periods, and correlated with the variants and lineages observed in patients from the same area time points. Based on a variation of the Illumina Arctic pipeline for the identification of mutations at low frequencies (< 0.01), and the lineage assignments defined by Pangolin, this method identifies all SARS-CoV-2 mutations present in the wastewater, and attempts to infer the potential distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages. The methodology is proven to be effective in detecting the mutational load in the wastewater, with the inferred lineages being roughly aligned to the predominant lineages identified through targeted (and therefore biased) patient-derived genotypes..

The proposed methodology was initially applied on a selected wastewater sample (corresponding to the 05-11 February 2021 time period), and for which three different variant callers were assessed: 1) freebayes, 2) mpileup and 3) GATK Mutect2 (cancer only mode). In terms of parameters, freebayes was used with a low variant frequency parameter of 0.01, mpileup reported every position (either reference, or variant), and GATK Mutect2 was used with the default parameters..

An example of the output produced by the methodology, regardless of the variant calling method, is shown in Table 1. In this table the overlap between the Pangolin’s rules and the rules generated by the tool for the input dataset is captured for each lineage. In order to quantify the overlap, three basic metrics are produced; the overlap by considering pangolin’s rules as a decision tree (Tree Overlap), the total overlap regardless of the rules order (Total Overlap), and the overlap for the rules that are satisfied only by the identified mutations (i.e., explicitly listed in the variants’ file), and therefore excluding all rules based on the unmutated reference (Total Overlap Var). In addition to the previous metrics, the related ratio values are also calculated (Tree ratio, Total Ratio, Total Ratio Var). Finally, information regarding the read depth for each position (reference and variant) is also provided in the output file..

Based on this detailed table, a second output is generated as a simplified summary. In this case, all rows for which the Total Overlap Var column was equal to 0 were removed, and therefore potential lineages that would be assigned based only on the unmutated reference (i.e., no actual mutations detected) are excluded from the analysis. The remaining rows were collapsed (Table 2) through a process in which the average values of the basic metrics were calculated for each lineage; i.e., the mean of the Tree Ratio, the Total Ratio, the Total Ratio Var, the Tree Av AD, the Total Av AD, and the Avg AF columns..

Depending on the variant caller tool used (freebayes, mpileup and GATK Mutect2), 
lineagespot
 generates a unique output. All outputs are compared pairwise, based on the decision tree rules (n

d
), and the total number of rules satisfied (n

t
). For each lineage, the absolute values of the differences between the two metrics (n

d
, n

t
) of the files are calculated. As an example, for lineage A.1, the output produced by using the freebayes variant caller tool in the first step of the methodology, returns n

d
 = 2 and n

t
 = 10 rules satisfied, while the output of the GATK Mutect2 tool returns n

d
 = 1 and n

t
 = 4 rules satisfied. As a result, the two outputs exhibit a difference of n

d
 = 1 and n

t
 = 6 rules (Table 3)..

In addition, the total number of lineages are shown in Table 4. In the same table, the maximum absolute n

d
 difference and the maximum n

t
 difference for each pair of files are calculated (Figure 1A). The latter is used for an overall comparison of the output files..

Based on the above comparison, we consider that the most productive and informative approach is to utilize freebayes as the variant calling tool. The rest of the results shown below, are based only on the freebayes tool output..

In order to investigate how specific variants, evolve over time, all variant files were merged into a combined table in which all the detected nucleotide variants along with the corresponding amino acid substitutions that have been identified are stored. Moreover, information about the read depth, the allele frequency, and the overlapping gene is also provided for each variant. Table 5 gives an example of the overall information..

Having a structured format, we first examined if the number of reads that were produced during PCR amplification is affecting the number of variants that are identified in every sample. For this reason, two replicates of the same biological specimen were produced. The first replicate (Replicate A) contained 181,880 reads while the second replicate (Replicate B) contained 69,706 reads. The two replicates were analyzed as described in the “Raw data analysis” Section and two VCF files were produced which contained 401 and 293 variants respectively; of these, 59 variants were common in both replicates, 342 variants were unique for Replicate A and 234 unique for Replicate B..

A Student’s t-test was performed in order to compare the mean values of the allele frequency between the two replicates and an F test to compare the variances. All tests resulted in p values higher than the 0.05 threshold, meaning that no statistically significant difference was found between the two replicates. On the contrary, when comparing two samples coming from different time periods there was a significant difference on the variants’ allele frequency (p values from Student’s t-test and F test were below 0.05)..

Moreover, for the same replicates, 6 different pairs of VCF files were generated in order to investigate how does the number of variants located changes while increasing the low variant frequency parameter of 0.01 that was used at freebayes tool during the raw data analysis. The thresholds that were chosen were 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5. In Figure 1B, the evolution of the number of variants found is shown while Figure 1C gives the corresponding allele frequency..

The proposed methodology was applied on the wastewater samples, across fourteen time periods, as show in Supplementary Table 1..

To this end, Table 5 was collapsed at the gene and amino acid substitution level, therefore reducing any data noise that is introduced by nucleotide mutations that correspond to the same amino acid change. In Figure 2A all variants were clustered accordingly based on Euclidean distance, while Figure 2B highlights specific variants (cluster 1) that exhibit significant difference in behavior..

Moreover, we studied the number of amino acid variants per gene over each time period. In Figure 2C the number of variants were clustered based on Euclidean distance, after all count values were normalized by each gene’s length..

Furthermore, the evolution of lineage-specific variants over the eleven time periods was studied. To this end, two Variants of Concern were selected; the B.1.1.7 (UK) and the B.1.351 (South Africa) lineages which are shown in Figure 3..

Moreover, we examined the prevalence rate of the two variants of concern by calculating the average allele frequency of their mutations. The results for the 14 time periods are presented in Table 6 and show that it does not lead to 100% sum per time period. The latter is caused, due to overlapping mutations among the lineages and implies that the average value of all the mutations is not a reliable metric to characterize a specific lineage’s presence..

Further in the analysis, we attempted to examine the minimal lineage support per time period. In this step we calculated the average allele frequency of the mutations unique to each variant of concern and produced a table which is more comparable with the clinical data metric. In this context, the minimum allele frequency of the present (greater than zero) mutations indicates the level of our confidence. The results of the two metrics are shown in Table 6..

Qualitative assessment between the major lineages found in the targeted clinical samples, retrieved from the ENA study ID: PRJEB44141 (ERP128154), and across the fourteen time periods. The clinical samples exhibit the lineage distribution shown in Table 7..

Based on the clinical results, as derived from targeted and non-randomized sampling of the Thessaloniki area, we can perform a direct comparison (Figure 4) between the level of presence in a particular variant of concern (B.1.1.7) in clinical and wastewater data..

By performing the analysis on the wastewater data, we identified the profiles presented in Table 8, that are representative of the most prevalent variants identified in each period and based on the lineage assignment model offered by the Pangolin tool..

Analyzing wastewater, i.e. used water that goes through the drainage system to a treatment facility, is a way that researchers and surveillance systems can track pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, or biomarkers that are excreted in urine or feces. Monitoring effluents could be a reliable and more effective tool to estimate SARS-CoV-2 spread compared to sampling and testing the population, because wastewater surveillance can account for those who have not been tested and have only mild or no symptoms. Moreover, an effective and reliable methodology able to detect viral load and SARS-CoV-2 variants from municipal wastewater samples could drastically, or at least help, decrease the cost of virus variant detection in the general population based on whole genome sequencing, since only a few samples must be processed and analyzed..

In this manuscript we present and validate a methodology named 
lineagespot
, making use of NGS data, able to detect lineages and mutational load of SARS-CoV2. The methodology aims to aid the epidemiological system for the monitoring of COVID-19 pandemic in urban areas..

The method has been tested in different time point samples taken from the main Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant of Thessaloniki - Greece, where effluents from approx. 750,000 inhabitants are collected. The 
lineagespot
 method demonstrated to be sensitive enough to identify and quantify differences in the mutational load, across various time points and was capable of recording the evolution of the B.1.1.7 lineage in the community. Moreover, the quantitative data obtained using 
lineagespot
 are in accordance with the trends of well-known mutations (such as Asp614Gly) in the same period with the overall epidemiological status of the municipal area. The application of 
lineagespot
 in such complex samples, like those from Wastewater Treatment Plants, was able to assign lineages and in agreement with the trend of the major lineages detected in the area of Thessaloniki, in the fourteen time points by whole genome sequencing of samples from the general population..

Overall, the method developed herein was proven superior compared to other methodologies (Sanger sequencing)
4,7
, since it was more informative and sensitive enough to detect mutations with low frequency and able to assign with good approximation the correct lineage present in the municipality..

Wastewater samples were collected from the entrance of the main Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant of the city which accommodates sewerage of about 750,000 inhabitants. Wastewater entering this plant refers exclusively to citizens from urban districts of the city. Typical values of certain physicochemical properties of wastewater samples tested in this study are displayed in Table 9. These properties demonstrate, among others, the existence of suspended solids, dissolved organic matter, dissolved oxygen and salinity that may have strong impact on viral adsorption and decay because of oxidation and increased metabolic activity of microorganisms in wastewater. The residence time of wastewater until the entrance of the Plant is between 2 and 7 hours (depending on the area), which is more than enough to allow viral adsorption and decay. Identification of mutations may be hindered by viral adsorption and decay and for this reason the present effort is particularly significant..

Sampling and handling of the wastewater samples were performed according to Petala et al
3
. Briefly, samples were obtained using a refrigerated autosampler (6712 Teledyne ISCO) programmed to deliver a 24-hours composite sample by mixing consecutive half-hour samples. Samples were transported to the lab on ice and were processed immediately. Three 50-mL aliquots of each untreated wastewater sample were subjected to centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 30 min. Afterwards, a composite sample was obtained from supernatants and pH was adjusted to 4 using 2 M HCl solution. Then, three aliquots of 40 mL each, were filtered through respective 0.45-μm pore-size, 47-mm diameter electronegative membranes (HAWP04700; Merck Millipore, Ireland). Each membrane filter was rolled into a Falcon™ 15-mL conical centrifuge tube with the top side facing inward, and was subjected to RNA extraction..

Each electronegative membrane was subjected to RNA extraction process based on a phenol-chloroform-method
8
 coupled with magnetic bead binding. The following reagents were added sequentially: a) 900 μL of guanidinium isothiocyanate-based “Lysis buffer I” [5 M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 25 mM EDTA, 25 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.0), 25 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.6)] containing 1% N-Lauroylsarcosine, 2% Triton X-100, 2% CTAB and 2% PVP, b) 18 μl β-mercaptoethanol, c) 300 μl H2O. Tubes mixed thoroughly by inversion and were stored at 4 °C for 10-30 min. Subsequently, 1.2 mL of “Lysis buffer II” [prepared by mixing 152.5 gr guanidinium hydrochloride, 31.25 mL of 2 M acetate buffer (pH 3.8) and water-saturated phenol stabilized (pH 4), at a final volume of 500 ml] was added, followed by incubation on a horizontal rotator (150 rpm, 10 min, RT). The liquid phase was transferred into a 2-mL microcentrifuge tube, was clarified by centrifugation (21,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and 1.6 mL of the supernatant were transferred to a new 2-mL tube, wherein 200 μl chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1) were added, followed by vigorous shaking for 30 s, incubation (−20°C, 30 min) and centrifugation (21,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The upper aqueous phase (800 μL) was transferred and mixed with 667 μL isopropanol and 20 μL of magnetic beads (IDEXX Water DNA/RNA Magnetic Bead Kit; IDEXX Laboratories Inc., Westbrook, ME, USA), followed by incubation on a horizontal rotator (150 rpm, 15 min, RT). The beads were washed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 100 μl buffer, and eluates were subjected to filtration, using the OneStep™ PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) and were stored at -80 °C. Extracted RNAs originating from 12 processed electronegative membranes and spanning 6 different days of sampling were pooled (1.1 mL total RNA extract) and mixed with 2.2 mL binding buffer containing isopropanol (IDEXX Water DNA/RNA Magnetic Bead Kit). Half of the mixture (1.65 mL) was incubated with 20 μL of magnetic beads on a horizontal rotator (150 rpm, 15 min, RT). After the magnetic separation of beads, the supernatant was removed and the procedure was repeated by adding the remaining 1.65 mL of the mixture. The beads were washed according to the manufacturer’s protocol and RNA was eluted in 60 μL buffer..

Concentrated RNAs were subjected to real-time RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 quantification, utilizing the N2 protocol proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in humans (CDC, 2020). The assay was performed on a CFX96 Touch™ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Calibration curves were generated using the synthetic single-stranded RNA standard “EURM-019” (Joint Research Centre, European Commission) and SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were expressed as genome copies per μL of RNA extract..

The targeted sequencing method was applied by preparing 400nt amplicons using the ARTIC v3 protocol developed by Wellcome Sanger Institute
9
, with some modifications. First, cDNA synthesis was prepared from 10 ul of RNA using Super Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen - Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and 50 ng/ul of random primers according to the protocol guidelines. For subsequent cDNA amplification, 2.5 μl of the generated cDNA was used instead of 6 μl, using ARTIC PCR primer pools (v3). Finally, the NEBNext adaptor (New England Biolabs, US, #7335) was used in the ligation reaction, diluted with adaptor dilution buffer at 10 μΜ final concentration. All purification steps were performed according to the ARTIC protocol. The samples were paired‐end sequenced on a MiSeq platform (Illumina, USA) with a read length of 2 × 300 bp..

The initial phase of the bioinformatics analysis is to produce an alignment of the sequencing reads, while maintaining extremely strict criteria, in order to remove any potential contaminants and/or sequencing errors. The first step is the adaptor removal process, where any adaptors were removed from the raw fastq sequences, with the cleaned reads mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (Wuhan variant, NC_045512), using minimap2 tool
10
 with a minimal chaining score (matching bases minus log gap penalty) equal to 40. From this process, only the paired-end sequences were retained, while any other (unmatched, multiple mappings, etc.) were removed. In the next step, two different computational workflows were employed, corresponding to the two different sequencing protocols employed. For the first seven samples and the last three (2 December 2020 – 18 March 2021 and 16 April 2021 – 06 May 2021), the primer sequences are excluded using the ivar tool
11
, setting a minimum of 200 length in nucleotides for a read to be retained after trimming, and a minimum threshold for sliding window of 15 quality to pass (width of sliding window equal to 4). The final sequences are then remapped to the same reference genome (minimal chaining score equal to 40). For the four samples between 19 March 2021 and 15 April 2021 primer trimming and remapping to reference genome was not applied, as the updated protocol used did not necessitate this step. Finally, in order to be able to detect low frequency variants, the freebayes variant caller was used with a low variant frequency parameter of 0.01. Ultimately, all identified mutations were annotated using the SnpEff tool
12
 and the NC_045512.2 (version 5.0) database..

In order to identify and assign different SARS-CoV-2 lineages based on the mutations detected from a single wastewater sample, we implemented the proposed methodology in a tool named 
lineagespot
. The tool accepts as input a VCF file, which contains all mutations identified in the sample, along with the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome file, and a file containing all lineage-assignment rules, as retrieved from the 
pangolin
 tool
13
 repository. After analyzing all inputs, a tab-delimited file (TSV file) is produced containing the most probable lineages that have been found. Figure 5 shows an overview of the tool’s functionalities, which can be described in 2 phases:.

In this phase all rules that can be derived from the VCF file are constructed. Initially, a vector of all genome positions is created, for which each position is set to be equal to the reference genome nucleotides. Then, the VCF file is read and a set of new rules is formed by setting each position of the file with the reported variant or multiple variants (in case there is more than one reported variant at the same position). It should be noted that positions that have been detected with more than one variant, should include all of them at the VCF’s ALT column in a comma-delimited format. Most of the variant caller tools (freebayes, GATK, etc.) are doing this by default. Finally, positions with reference read depth equal to zero are removed from the first vector. The remaining two vectors are merged into one..

In addition to finding all positions that need to be set equal to the base that has been allocated, four more rules are added for each genome position. These rules contain all bases not equal to the nucleotide of the original rule. For example, if position 5388 is equal to base ‘A’ (representing rule 5388==’A’), then four new rules are added containing all bases not equal to ‘A’, e.g., 5888!=’T’, 5388!=’G’, 5388!=’C’, 5388!=’-’ (where the ‘-’ symbol stands for a gap in the referred sequence). Finally, all rules are merged into a single vector representing this particular lineage..

The second phase aims to compare the rules derived from the VCF file with the assignment rules provided by the pangolin tool. Specifically, all decision rules are read from the input pangolin file, and for each lineage, the related rules are compared with the final rule vector..

Three metrics are computed and stored in the output file; the total number of rules leading to the related lineage (N

r
), the number of rules satisfied by the created rule vector, considering pangolin’s rules as a decision tree (n

d
), and the total number of rules satisfied (n

t
). Also, the related ratio values are being computed, giving a satisfaction percentage of each lineage: 



R
d

.

It should be noted that the methodology relies on the following assumption. Given a group of reads that satisfy a rule A of lineage L, and another group of reads that satisfy rule B from the same lineage L, then the lineage L is incorrectly assigned. As an example, suppose that a group of reads satisfy only the first two rules from lineage B.1.177.17 (28931!=’A’, 25613!=’G’), and another group of reads satisfy the next two rules from the same lineage (407!=’-’, 22087!=’A’). Based on the method description above, lineage B.1.177.17 will be marked as an identified lineage, even though none of the reads satisfy all of the lineage’s rules..

In order to mitigate this risk, we are taking into consideration a number of different indicators, that reflect the number of total rules satisfied, the number of rules that are satisfied based on the detected mutations, and the overall number of reads that support both reference and allele for each of the rules..

For the detection of lineage-specific mutations, three different data sources were used; pangolin, VEO and outbreak.info. An example of the differences of the three sources is provided in Supplementary Figure 1, which compares the detection of B.1.1.7 using A outbreak.info, B pangolin and C VEO data..
