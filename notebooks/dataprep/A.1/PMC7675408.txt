The genomic sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) worldwide are publicly available and are derived from studies due to the increase in the number of cases. The importance of study of mutations is related to the possible virulence and diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2. To identify circulating mutations present in SARS‐CoV‐2 genomic sequences in Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala to find out if the same strain spread to the south, and analyze the specificity of the primers used for diagnosis in these samples. Twenty three complete SARS‐CoV‐2 genomic sequences, available in the GISAID database from May 8 to September 11, 2020 were analyzed and aligned versus the genomic sequence reported in Wuhan, China (NC_045512.2), using Clustal Omega. Open reading frames were translated using the ExPASy Translate Tool and UCSF Chimera (v.1.12) for amino acid substitutions analysis. Finally, the sequences were aligned versus primers used in the diagnosis of COVID‐19. One hundred and eighty seven distinct variants were identified, of which 102 are missense, 66 synonymous and 19 noncoding. P4715L and P5828L substitutions in replicase polyprotein were found, as well as D614G in spike protein and L84S in ORF8 in Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala. The primers design by CDC of United States showed a positive E value. The genomic sequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 in Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala present similar mutations related to a virulent strain of greater infectivity, which could mean a greater capacity for inclusion in the host genome and be related to an increased spread of the virus in these countries, furthermore, its diagnosis would be affected..

The first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) were reported in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China
1
, 
2
; thus initiating the coronavirus pandemic (COVID‐19).
3
 According to the information released from scientists around the world and the GISAID consortium, until September 15, 2020, SARS‐CoV‐2 has caused 29,445,572 cases worlwide and 931,454 deaths.
4
 According to predictions,
5
 the total number of deaths will increase to 2,778,330 by January 1, 2021..

To identify how the virus spread, cross‐sectional studies with phylogenetic analysis and markers that identified mutations were implemented.
6
 It is known from epidemiological reports that the first cases started in Mexico from the East, particularly from the United States, Spain, France, Germany, Singapore, and especially from Bergamo, Italy.
7
, 
8
 In addition, we think that the dispersion went from Mexico to Belize and Guatemala, and therefore, there could be the same molecular characteristics, for this reason we included these three countries in our study..

SARS‐CoV‐2 is closely related to the SARS‐CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
9
 Its structure contains a single‐stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome with a length of 29,903 bp. It comprised of a 5ʹ‐untranslated region (5ʹ‐UTR), a conserved replicase domain (ORF1ab) cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs) that participate in virus transcription and genome replication, four structural proteins (S, E, M, and N), several accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, and ORF10), and a highly conserved 3ʹ‐UTR

Genomic structure of SARS‐CoV‐2.

NCBI reference sequence: NC_045512.2..

The ORF1ab gene encodes for replicase polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab), which is constituted of NSPs (NSP1, NSP2…NSP16). Of these, NSP12 corresponds to RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and is formed by 932 amino acids (4392–5324 residues). The spike (S) protein has been described as responsible for the interaction with the human receptor angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)
14
; it is constituted of two domains, the S1 domain, responsible for binding, and the S2 domain that mediates the fusion of the viral and cellular membrane.
15
 Moreover, S1 has variations but S2 is highly conserved.
16

.

Nonsynonymous substitution changes the protein sequences, these have been reported in SARS‐CoV‐2 in the functional domains of ORF3a.
17
 Issa et al.
17
 reported that these substitutions are related to virulence, infectivity, ion channel formation, and virus release. ORF3a mutations have been found in other countries such as India.

We analyze and identify the characteristics of circulating SARS‐CoV‐2 mutations present in genomic sequences in Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala, to find out if they have the same molecular characteristics, we also evaluate how these mutations affect the primer design for reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC US), CDC China, Charité (Germany), Hong Kong University, and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Japan). The results indicated the presence of similar mutations in ORF1ab, S (S1, S2 or S2'), ORF 3a, ORF7a, ORF8, and N, as well as in the noncoding (5ʹ‐UTR and 3ʹ‐UTR) and intergenic regions (between ORF3a and E gene) in strains from Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala. Also, we found that primers from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC US) could present low specificity..

We analyzed 457 SARS‐CoV‐2 genomic sequences from Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala available in the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) from May 8 until September 11, 2020. Of these, we only selected the complete sequences with approximately 29.800–29.900 base pairs (bp); 23 from Mexico (EPI_ISL_426362, EPI_ISL_424667, EPI_ISL_455456, EPI_ISL_426364, EPI_ISL_426363, EPI_ISL_424670, EPI_ISL_424673, EPI_ISL_516613, EPI_ISL_516620, EPI_ISL_454555, EPI_ISL_412972, EPI_ISL_452139, EPI_ISL_424672, EPI_ISL_516625, EPI_ISL_424626, EPI_ISL_455434, EPI_ISL_516609, EPI_ISL_496369, EPI_ISL_493348, EPI_ISL_493336, EPI_ISL_516611, EPI_ISL_455438, and EPI_ISL_496374), four from Belize (EPI_ISL_509713, EPI_ISL_509714, EPI_ISL_509712, and EPI_ISL_509711), and 10 from Guatemala (EPI_ISL_509710, EPI_ISL_509700, EPI_ISL_509699, EPI_ISL_509696, EPI_ISL_509695, EPI_ISL_509702, EPI_ISL_509703, EPI_ISL_509697, EPI_ISL_509698, and EPI_ISL_509701)..

Genomic alignments were performed using Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) versus the SARS‐CoV‐2 genomic sequence reported from Wuhan, China (NCBI accession number NC_045512.2) as reference. Open reading frames (ORFs) containing the identified variants were translated using the ExPASy Translate Tool (https://web.expasy.org/translate/) using standard code. Variants and their amino acids were used to create a table of variants (Table 2)..

The amino acids corresponding to mutations D614G in the spike protein, P4715L in RdRp, and L84S in ORF8 protein were replaced by Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) v.1.9.1 (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/) and visualized with Chimera v. 1.1.12 (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/), taking as templates structures from Protein the Data Bank (PDB) proposed by Zhang et al.
19
 For the spike protein, we used 6VSB.pdb, which corresponds to the trimeric protein in open conformation that includes the S1 and S2 subdomains
20
 while for the RdRp, we took chain A of 6M71.pdb reported by Gao et al.
21

.

As of September 09, 2020, the crystallographic structure of the ORF8 protein has not been reported, thus we take the one proposed by the Iterative Threading Assembly Refinement (I‐TASSER) server
22
 (QHD43422.pdb). Also, in Mexico, the Berlin test with four oligonucleotides for the RdRp gene (GTGARATGGTCATGTGTGGCGG, FAM‐CAGGTGGAACCTCATCAGGAGATGC‐BBQ, FAM‐CCAGGTGGWACRTCATCMGGTGATGC‐BBQ, CARATGTTAAASACACTATTAGCATA), three for the E gene (ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT, FAM‐ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG‐BBQ, ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA) and three for the N gene (CACATTGGCACCCGCAATC, FAM‐ACTTCCTCAAGGAACAACATTGCCA‐BBQ, GAGAACGAGAAGAGGCTTG)
23
 are the reference in the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference “Dr. Manuel Martínez Báez” (InDRE) of the Secretary of Health of Mexico. In addition, the Institute has approved 53 molecular tests from different world companies for the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2. These tests detect different genes and use different primers with different analytical sensitivity (limit of detection; https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/576584/Listado_de_estuches_comerciales_utiles_para_el_diagn_stico_de_SARS-CoV-2.pdf)..

On the other hand, the governments of Belize and Guatemala obtain diagnostic tests with different primers and with recommendations from the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization (https://www.pressoffice.gov.bz/government-of-belize-to-procure-covid-19-test-kits-from-cayman-islands/; https://www.paho.org/es/documentos/directrices-laboratorio-para-deteccion-diagnostico-infeccion-con-virus-covid-19). The genomic sequences were aligned with primers used in the diagnosis of COVID‐19 by the RT‐PCR using the Sequence Manipulation Site: PCR Products tool v.2 (https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/pcr_products.html) and Primer3Plus v.2.4.2 (https://primer3plus.com/cgi-bin/dev/primer3plus.cgi), including the sequence NC_045512.2 as reference..

The expect‐value (E value) is a statistical parameter that describes the probability of the significance of an alignment. The lower the E‐value, the lower the alignment error; thus, the efficiency of the RT‐PCR amplification could show a higher concentration of product per cycle. We evaluated this and other characteristics of these tests,
24
 such as the variations in specificity reported in the melting curve‐based multiplex quantitative RT‐PCR (RT‐qPCR) Assay for Human Coronaviruses
25
 and secondary structures for other viruses,
26
 for this reason, their specificity and E values were determinaed through the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome) and the melting temperature (Tm) using Oligo Analyzer program development by Sigma‐Aldrich Co. (http://www.oligoevaluator.com/LoginServlet)..

A total of 187 distinct variants were found in Mexico, 54 in Guatemala, and 39 in Belize. Alignment of genomic sequences of the three countries shared an approximately 99.9% identity. Of these variants, 161 correspond to transitions in Mexico, 50 to transitions in Guatemala and 31 to transitions in Belize (Figure 1) and the rest to transversions. The most common variant in all cases was C>T, which represents an average 52% of the variants that mainly correspond to ORF1ab (Figure 1). The translation revealed 46 amino acid substitutions and 28 synonyms. The substitutions in the noncoding regions included one in C106T and sixteen in C241T of 5ʹ‐UTR, one of 3ʹ‐UTR (A29700G), and also, one intergenic variant located between ORF3a and E (T26232C) in Mexico; while in Guatemala, we identified 13 amino acid substitutions and five synonyms..

Nucleotide variations and distribution identified in the SARS‐CoV‐2 genomic sequences from Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.

The variants were distributed in six genes, four of which presented the highest number of mutations (almost 86%). The ORF1ab gene presented the maximum number of mutations, 15 amino acid substitutions, and 16 synonymous, followed by the S gene, with six substitutions and five synonymous. The third gene with the most mutations was the N gene, which contained six nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions and one synonym. And finally, in the ORF8 gene, six substitutions were observed. In the ORF7a gene, only one mutation (G38V) was found; while in the ORF3a gene, one substitution (G196V) and two synonymous (I232) were localized. Figure 1 shows the distribution of mutations in SARS‐CoV‐2 genomic sequences, including noncoding and intergenic regions. Furthermore, the distribution of the variants in the sequences, where the most common variants in all sequences were C>T and A>G. The variations observed in each genomic sequence are presented in Tables 2, 3, 4..

We also localized NSP12 which corresponds to RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and shows that the active sites are formed by the conserved amino acids D760 and D761 (blue spheres). Likewise, there are residues in the 5 Angstrom region (Å) that surround the active aspartates (in magenta bars, amino acids V763, C622, N695, Y619, E811 and F812); and residues H295, C301, C306, C310, H647, C487, C645 and C646 (in orange sticks) correspond to the binding sites of Zn+ ions. The mutation P4715L (red spheres) corresponds to amino acid 323 in RdRp and as it can be observed, do not affect, or influence active sites (Figure 2A). Also, Figure 2B shows an overall view of the trimeric spike protein. The D614G mutations found in Mexico, Belize and Guatemala were 29 out of a total of 37 strains..

G614 mutation is far away from important residues for attachment (RBD in green light spheres) and fusion (fusion peptides, red spheres, residues 788–806) with membrane. Visualization using Chimera UCSF, v.1.12.

In Mexico, the genome sequences that we found had four sequences with lineage A5 and clade S; four sequences with linage A1 and clade S; three sequences with linage B1 and clade G; six sequences with linage B1.5 with clade G; one sequence with linage B1 and clade GH; two sequences with lineage B1.1 and clade GR; one sequence with lineage B1.2 and clade GH; one sequence with lineage B1 and clade GR and one sequence with lineage B1.75 with clade G. However, in Guatemala, we found four genome sequences with lineage B1.5 with clades O, four genome sequences with lineage B1.5 and clades G, one genome sequence with lineage B1 and clade H, and another with lineage A3 with clade S. In the genome sequences from Belize, we found two B1 lineages with H clades, and two other genomes with the B1.1 lineage and R clade..

A 3D model of ORF8 protein was obtained using the data of that proposed by Yang Zhang Lab, with its binding sites. ORF8 protein is 121 residues in length.

 Figure 3 illustrates the spatial distribution of the L84S mutation along with R48, G50, L57, P56, Q72, and Y73 residues, which could be a glycerol binding site. S97 and L98 could be a region that binds to an Hg+ ion likewise, ORF8 could be related to pathogenesis.

The in silico analysis of the primers is used in the RT‐qPCR for detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Table 5). The results reported by Yan et al.
28
 and Udugama et al.,
29
 show that most of the primers contain 23%–58% of guanine‐cytosine content (GC). These generate a few dimers, as well as having a very weak or weak secondary structure, and possess a melting temperature (Tm) among 48.7°C–71.7°C. Also, we show the high sensitivity of the primers used because the E value is close to zero, except in the set designed by CDC from the United States where the E value is positive, indicating low sensitivity..

Primers designed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Charité (Germany), and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Japan) for the RdRp, N and S genes give a product using Primer3Plus, and similarly, multiple alignments (Table 5). This indicates a high sensitivity to these primers, however, four sets of primers used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC US) present low sensitivity to RdRp, S, and N amplicons. They are misaligned with the primer forward that can recognize 11/19 base pairs causing low sensitivity..

The genomic sequences of first SARS‐CoV‐2 strain in Mexico (hCoV/Mexico/CDMX/InDRE_01/2020) show high identity with the sequence reported in China Wuhan‐Hu‐1 (NC_045512.2), it only differs in seven nucleotide substitutions.
8
 This high sequence identity has been attributed to the recent spread of the virus in humans, suggesting a common lineage and source.
10
, 
35
 Our results show 84% more transitions than transversions. The effects of transition and transversion mutations have been studied in influenza (H1N1) and the human immunodeficiency virus virus, these studies conclude that it is likely that transversions cause radicals changes in amino acids
29
, 
36
 that could be involved in the high genomic conservation of the new coronavirus..

Different reports of variant analysis of SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes show similar results to those of Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala, for example, Koyama et al.
37
 reported that C>T was the most common variant; they also identified mutations in C3037T (F924), C14408T (P4715L) in RdRp, ORF1ab and, A23403G (D614G) in the spike, this was reported mainly in Europe and the United States.
35
, 
38
 Additionally, D614G formed the largest phylogenic clade including C241T, F924, and P4715L, while the second largest clade was T28144C (L84S) present in ORF8, which was reported days after the outbreak in travelers from Wuhan. Among the L84S clade, the L84S/C17747T (P5828L) subclade was more frequent in the United States.
37
, 
38
 Regarding the P4715L mutation, it corresponds to amino acid residue 323 in the RdRp; however, it does not affect or influence the active sites (Figure 2A), according to Yang et al.,
39
 who predicted active site residues in the same region. Similarly, Khailany et al.,
40
 reported that C>T was the most frequent mutation observed and also found C8782T (S2839) mutations in ORF1ab and T28144C (L84S) in ORF8 genes. We did not identify the mutation in the C29095T (F274) N gene.
39

.

Moreover, current evidence of the mutation of an aspartate (D) at position 614 to glycine (G) in spike is possibly related to increased infectivity,
41
 but also gives a more pathogenic strain. The G614G mutation alters the fusion of the cell membrane and the data reveals that it is located in a highly glycosylated region that also allows the identification of two viral clades.
39
, 
42
 The aspartate strain has been found in cases reported on the West Coast of United States, while the glycine strain has been reported on the East Coast.
43
 In Mexico, our study revealed the presence of the D614 in samples, identified in a smaller number of cases at the moment of sequencing..

SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes have two major lineages with sublineages A (1, 2, 3, and 5) and B (1, 1.1, 2, 3, and 4).
44
 In Mexico, Taboada et al.
45
 found that the lineages changed from late February to March from A2 to B1. Considering that we selected only the complete sequences, we found a higher proportion of B lineages and clades G as in Guatemala and Belize..

Lineages have been associated with certain clinical manifestations.
35
 Lineage A has sequences from Europe and conforms to a human coronavirus (HCoV‐OC43 and HCoV‐HKU1), may be associated with self‐limiting upper respiratory infections, and occasionally, with lower respiratory tract infections; while lineage B may cause severe lower respiratory tract infections with acute respiratory distress syndrome and extrapulmonary manifestations.
43

.

We found a mutation in the noncoding regions 5ʹ‐UTR (C241T), this type of mutation in UTRs of SARS‐Cov‐2 has been studied recently, suggesting that C241T in 5ʹ‐UTR appeared early during the outbreak, and could be key in virus replication and RNA folding,
46
 affecting the steam‐loop 5b (SL5b)
47
, 
48
 and the host defense.
49
 The intergenic mutation A29700G located between ORF3a and E genes might emerge through adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) and could be important in the antiviral response
28
, 
35
, 
50
 reducing the stability in the RNA fold.
29

.

Activation of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein via sequential proteolytic cleavage can be at two distinct sites. For many CoVs, the spike protein is cleaved at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits (residues 685 and 686), which remain non covalently bound in the prefusion conformation while for all CoVs, the spike is further cleaved by host proteases at the so‐called S2 site located immediately upstream of the fusion peptide (residues 788–806).
51
 Also, RBD is constituted by residues 333–527 and belongs to a region that attaches to hACE2, a highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor‐binding domains of SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV.
52
 As we can see, the D614G mutation is not between important regions known, but recently has been associated with high prevalence, from <1% in January to 69% in March. The global spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 subtype with spike protein D614G mutation is shaped by Human Genomic Variations that regulate the expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 genes, although the mechanism by which such a phenomenon occurs is not clear yet.
53

.

The ORF8 protein has 121 residues in length and very little is known about its function. Nevertheless, Zhang et al.
22
 have proposed a 3D model along with its binding sites. The L84S mutation in genomic sequences in Mexico can indicate that the circulating strain shows a different characteristic, like the Wuhan strain. However, the number of analyzed samples is a limitation of guarantee. Due to several reports of low sensitivity in the RT‐PCR test, which is not considered the gold standard for diagnosis of COVID‐19,
54
, 
55
 we analyzed a predictive evaluation of the sensitivity of the primers used (Table 5)..

The N gene has a high degree of conservation in coronaviruses,
56
 however, in our study, the N gene is the third with the highest number of mutations, following the ORF1ab and S genes. The results suggest a high sensitivity of the primers. Nevertheless, that designed by CDC (US) for the RdRp gene, could generate low sensitivity of the forward and reverse primer related to the few complementary bases already reported.
57
 Besides this, the mutations AAC (28881–28883) in the N gene could decrease sensitivity because they are part of the region where the primer is attached to the template strand. As a consequence, it is not recognized by Primer3Plus. We considered that not all primers possess high sensitivity for diagnosing of COVID‐19, and the mutations in the genomic sequences may decrease just the sensitivity. Recently in China, it has been reported that nonspecific primers may amplify high concentrations of human cathepsin C (CTSC) and messenger RNA in the tonsils. This could cause interference in diagnosing COVID‐19,
58
 which could explain why RT‐PCR should not be considered the gold standard. Furthermore, the test presents other problems, such as those related to errors in swab tests, causing improper extraction of viral RNA.
59
 A comprehensive review of the diagnosis of COVID‐19 can be found at Yan et al.
22
 and Li and Ren.
60

.

As time passes, mutations in the genomic sequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 could appear in the highly conserved regions and the effectiveness of the diagnostic methods could be compromised. Factors, such as correct sampling, conservation and transport of the sample, extraction
61
 quality and integrity of RNA,
37
 calibration of the thermocycler, and optimal amplification conditions, may influence the results. Likewise, the design of primers in conserved regions is essential, and experimental studies are required for a wider understanding. Finally, several questions related to the mutations remain, a very important one is whether these mutations are related to the observed case‐fatality rate. Until September 13, 2020, Mexico has a very high case‐fatality rate of 10.6%, Belize 1.3%, and Guatemala 3.6%, in addition to a high number of people with comorbidities.
