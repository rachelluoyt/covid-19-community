All neuron types in the nervous system are defined by a battery of molecular features that
endow them with specific functional features. One key identity feature of a neuron is its
neurotransmitter identity. To understand how neurons acquire their unique identity, it is of
paramount interest to map neurotransmitter identity throughout the nervous system and to
then study how neurotransmitter identity is genetically specified – and perhaps even
modulated under specific conditions. I will describe here my laboratories efforts to
comprehensively assign neurotransmitter identity to all neurons in the nervous system of the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. I will then go on to describe the gene regulatory
mechanisms that specify neuro-transmitter identity throughout the entire nervous system of
the worm. I will describe the plasticity of neurotransmitter identity in the intriguing
context of sexual maturation, showing that neurotrans-mitter deployments changes
differentially in the same neuron type of the opposite sex and I will describe the molecular
mechanisms that bring about such changes..

Oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination are tightly regulated, and the mechanistic
Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is one important regulator of CNS myelination. mTOR functions
through two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2, by binding to either
Raptor or Rictor, respectively. mTORC1 has been studied extensively, whereas mTORC2 is less
well studied, but known to impact the cytoskeleton. In order to establish whether mTORC1 and
mTORC2 have unique functions during CNS myelination, we conditionally ablated either Raptor
or Rictor in the oligo-dendrocyte lineage in vivo. Raptor deletion using the 2’,3’ cyclic
nucleotide phosphohydrolase (CNP) promoter resulted in significant hypomyelination in spinal
cord, which phenocopied related studies deleting mTOR itself. By contrast, when Rictor
(mTORC2) was comparably deleted, it had little impact on myelination. When Rictor was
selectively deleted in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), however, using the platelet
derived growth factor receptor alpha promoter (PDGFRa-Cre), significantly reduced
myelination was seen in corpus callosum, although not spinal cord. Thus, loss of Rictor/
mTORC2 impacts oligodendrocytes quite differently from that of mTORC1 or mTOR. We
hypothesize that mTORC2 is crucial for early cytoskeletal changes, in particular the actin
cytoskeleton. In Rictor-deleted cells, dramatic reductions in differentiation were seen,
with reduced branching as cells mature. Other regulators of the cytoskeleton include
p21-activated kinase1 (PAK1), which promotes OPC morphological differentiation and myelin
production. Inhibiting PAK1 early in oligodendrocyte development decreases oligodendro-cyte
morphological complexity and alters F-actin spreading at the tips of OPC processes. How
these cytoskeleton modulators are regulated is a major focus of these studies. Supported by
NIH R37 NS082203..

Neuronal endosomes are essential for membrane receptor trafficking to and within dendrites
and axons. Endosomes participate in a variety of signaling events, as well as regulating the
rates of recycling and degradation. In neurons, endosomal trafficking is involved in
receptor trafficking and various neuronal functions, such as synaptic plasticity and axon
outgrowth. Dysfunctions of the endo-lysosomal system have been implicated in a number of
neuro-degenerative conditions. As in other cell types, neuronal endosomes are regulated by a
variety of endosomal regulators, such as Rab proteins, which localize to different endosomal
compartments. We use a rapidly degrading membrane protein as a tool to study the regulation
of degradation in time and space along dendrites. We show that degradative lysosomes are
clustered in proximal dendrites and in the soma, leading to a steep spatial gradient of
degradative capacity along dendrites. Terminal degradation of dendritic cargos requires
Rab7-dependent transport to the soma, suggesting that trafficking of proteins from the
dendrites is required for degradation in the soma. Proteostasis is thus spatially regulated
in neurons..

Defective brain hormonal signaling has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), a
disorder characterized by synapse and memory failure. Irisin is an exercise-induced myokine
released on cleavage of the membrane-bound precursor protein fibronectin type III
domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), also expressed in the hippocampus. We found that
FNDC5/irisin is reduced in AD hippocampi and cerebrospinal fluid, and in the brains of
experimental AD models. Knockdown of brain FNDC5/irisin impairs hippocampal long-term
potentiation and novel object recognition memory in mice. Conversely, boosting brain levels
of FNDC5/irisin rescues synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mouse models. Peripheral
overex-pression of FNDC5/irisin rescues memory impairment, whereas blockade of either
peripheral or brain FNDC5/irisin attenuates the neuroprotective actions of physical exercise
on synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mice. By showing that FNDC5/irisin is an important
mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise in AD models, our findings place FNDC5/irisin
as a novel agent capable of opposing synapse failure and memory impairment in AD..

Neurodegenerative diseases (ND), such as Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS and
others, are often caused by mutant proteins that misfold in the cell, leading to the
accumulation of protein aggregates. Misfolded and aggregated proteins are usually targeted
by an elaborate network of molecular chaperones, the master regulators of protein folding in
the cell. However, in the case of ND, the chaperone network is unable to successfully handle
these patho-logical aggregates. While several studies highlighted important roles for a
handful of chaperones in modulating aggregation, the roles of individual chaperones in
regulation of aggregation has not been systematically examined, and the potential function
of many of them in aggregation modulation is still largely unknown..

Here we describe a novel framework to test the roles of chaperone network perturbations in
modulation of ND-related protein aggregation. In combination with a chaperone screen, we are
able to quantitatively measure the functional effect of chaperones in the net-work on
protein aggregation phenotypes. Focusing on protein aggregation related to Huntington's
disease and ALS, we identified multiple different chaperones that significantly alleviate
protein aggregation, while many others aggravate aggregation phenotype. Interestingly,
aggregate types related to different NDs were rescued or aggravated by different chaperones.
Surprisingly, different naturally occurring isoforms of some chaperones show differential
functional effects on aggregation modulation. We investigated the roles of these isoforms in
aggregation rescue, and revealed underlying principles of their roles in regulating the
phenotype of different aggregate types..

Together, our data unraveled the regulatory role of chaperone networks in dealing with
protein aggregates, towards the ultimate goal of understanding how potential network
rewiring could defend cells against ND-related protein aggregation, and provided future
nodes for therapeutic intervention..

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition linked to the
gradual accumulation of α-synuclein amyloid inclusions in the brain. The progressive
conversion of monomeric soluble α-synuclein into toxic oligomeric and fibrillar species
results in the formation of highly stable, ordered aggregates that constitute atypical
substrates for the cellular protein quality control machinery. The constitutive human Hsp70
chaperone (Hsc70), assisted by co-chaperones DNAJB1 and Apg2, generates a powerful
ATP-dependent disaggregation activity that efficiently resolubilizes α-synuclein amyloid
fibrils in vitro. Combining NMR spectroscopy, equilibrium and kinetic
binding experiments and disaggregation activity assays, we dissect the functional cycle of
Hsc70 to build a detailed picture of chaperone action on an amyloid substrate. Our data
provide crucial new insights into the mode of action of Hsc70 on amyloid fibrils and
highlights the essential role of co-chaperones in the activity of Hsc70..

UNDERSTANDING PROTEOSTASIS DISFUNCTION AND AGGREGATE MANAGEMENT IN NEURODEGENERATIVE
DISEASE

Achieving correct protein folding and quality control is essential for normal cellular
function. The accumulation of misfolded proteins is emerging as central to a wide range of
disease states, including many neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's and Prion
Disease. Molecular chaperones are a diverse family of enzymes that monitor and maintain all
aspects of protein homeostasis. The role of chaperones in protein quality control functions
will be discussed..

Chaperones assist the folding of newly translated and stress-denatured proteins, as well as
affects protein quality control. A stress-inducible chaperone network protects cells from
environmental stress and assists quality control. These chaperones also communicate with the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to clear misfolded proteins from the cell. Protein quality
control in the eukaryotic cytosol relies on the sequestration of misfolded cytosolic
proteins in specific quality control compartments. Our studies of chaperone function provide
a framework to understand the link between protein misfolding and aggregate management in
neuro-degenerative disease..

LIVER LOCALIZED FABP-1 INFLUENCES BRAIN ENDOCANNABINOID AND ARACHIDONIC ACID
LEVELS
.

Eric Murphy.


University of North Dakota, Biomedical Sciences, Grand Forks, USA
.

Fatty acid binding protein-1 (FABP1) is localized in liver and its expression in L-cells
demonstrates its important role in cellular fatty acid uptake and trafficking. In addition,
its expression in L-cells increases phospholipid mass, including an increase in plasmalogen
mass, suggesting an important role in phospholipid biosynthesis. In the brain, there are
three FABP expressed, FABP3 found in neurons, FABP5 found in neurons and glia, and FABP7
localized in astrocytes. We have previously demonstrated that FABP3 has an important, yet
ill-defined role in maintaining plasmalogen levels in the brain. Further, our work
demonstrates that FABP3 is important for arachidonic acid (20:4n-6, ARA) uptake and
trafficking in whole brain. Recently, in collaboration with the Schroeder laboratory at
Texas A & M University, we demonstrate that in the absence of FABP1 expression in the
liver, that brain 20:4n-6 level is increased, putatively via modulation of its level in
serum. More importantly, lack of its expression also demonstrates an important role in brain
endocannabinoid levels, mainly 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), although levels of other
endocannabinoids are also impacted. This is important because the FABP1 T94A mutation, which
is seen in individuals who suffer from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, bio-chemically acts
similar to the FABP1 null. This mutation is thought to be present in up to 25% of Americans.
Collectively, our findings suggest that it is important to delineate the importance of this
FABP1 mutation in influencing not only the brain 20:4n-6 levels, but also 2-AG levels in
these individuals. This especially important due to the importance of the endocannabinoid
system in satiety and other physiological functions controlled by the brain..

YIN-YANG MECHANISMS REGULATING LIPID PEROXIDATION OF DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID AND
ARACHIDONIC ACID
.

Grace Sun.


University of Missouri, Dept Biochemistry, Columbia, USA
.

Docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6, ARA) are two prominent
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in phospholipids in the Central Nervous System (CNS).
These PUFAs are metabolically active partly through the “deacylation-reacylation” cycle
mediated by phospholipases A2 (PLA2) and acyltransferases. Recent studies have provided
evidence for metabolism of these PUFAs through different types of phos-pholipase A2 (PLA2),
namely, the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) for release of ARA and the
calcium-independent iPLA2 for release of DHA. These different PLA2s formed the basis of the
Yin-Yang mechanism for metabolism of phospholipids with DHA and ARA. In turn, ARA is known
for production of eicosanoids, which are largely pro-inflammatory, whereas docosanoids
produced by DHA are neuroprotective and pro-resolving. Both PUFAs are also susceptible to
lipid peroxidation mediated by oxygen free radicals and resulting in the production of
4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) from DHA and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) from ARA. Although the
physiological role for these peroxidation products have not been studied in detail,
increases in 4-HNE have been linked to the cPLA2/ ARA pathway due to neuronal excitation,
stroke, and traumatic brain injury. In contrary, increases in 4-HHE were linked to dietary
supplementation with DHA. DHA supplementation not only results in increase in phospholipid
species with (n-3) PUFA but also decrease in phospholipid species with (n-6) PUFA.
Interestingly, while changes in (n-3)/(n-6) phospholipids due to dietary DHA could be shown
in all brain regions, the related increase in 4-HHE appeared to occur mainly in the cerebral
cortex and hippocampus, suggesting enrichment in lipid peroxidative activity in these brain
regions. Since alkenyl aldehydes are metabolically active and can form adducts with proteins
and nucleic acids, it is worth future studies to investigate whether changes in 4-HHE due to
DHA supplementation may provide specific physiologic role in brain health and disease
processes..

LIPIDOMIC CHARACTERIZATION OF PRO-REPAIR LIPID PATHWAYS IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
.

Ameer Taha.


University of California - Davis, Food Science and Technology, Davis, USA
.

Background: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are
neurodegenerative disorders that lack effective treatments and well-defined etiologies.
Previous lipidomic studies have shown reductions in lipid mediators known to promote
neuronal repair, in serum of AD and MS patients compared to unaffected controls. The
cause(s) of these changes remain unknown..

Hypothesis and objectives: The present study tested the hypothesis that
pro-repair lipid mediators are reduced in post-mortem brains of AD and MS patients because
they are actively sequestered by brain esterified lipid pools..

Methods: Post-mortem pre-frontal cortex of AD and MS subjects, and unaffected
controls, was submitted to lipidomic analysis with liquid chromatography coupled to
mass-spectrometry following isolation of brain unesterified and esterified lipid pools..

Results: Compared to controls, pro-repair lipid mediator concentrations within
neutral lipids were reduced in AD, but increased in MS. No significant changes were observed
in unesterified lipid mediators..

Conclusion: This study provides new evidence of altered pro-repair lipid
mediator turnover within pre-frontal cortex neutral lipids of MS and AD patients. Targeting
this pathway might promote neuronal repair by increasing the availability of unbound,
pro-repair lipid mediators in brain..

BRAIN CERAMIDE ACCUMULATION: A NOVEL DRIVER OF NEURODEGENERATION IN ALZHEIMER'S
DISEASE
.

To date effective disease modifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies remain elusive.
Thus, delaying the onset or progression of AD represents a major unmet health care need that
is an urgent matter of public health. Better-elucidation of AD pathogenesis is a critical
step forward towards developing more effective therapeutics. Although amyloid-β (Aβ) is
considered the central neurotoxic component of AD pathogenesis, it accumulates decades
before the onset of AD, and by itself is not sufficient to cause dementia. Unraveling the
major molecular mechanisms downstream of Aβ that drive neurodegeneration represents a
critical knowledge gap that remains to be elucidated..

Dr. Alzheimer noted remarkable glial lipid granule accumulation..

Despite these early observations, glial lipoid deposits have been mostly neglected by the
literature for decades. More recently, human genetic studies also point to lipid metabolism
as a major player in AD etiology. Despite century-old and recent mounting evidence
associating lipid metabolism with AD, and the fact that the brain is the richest organ in
terms of lipid content and diversity, lipids are commonly “forgotten” by the AD field.
Ceramides, the central core molecules in the metabolism of sphingolipids, have been
established as a potent bioactive agent involved in multiple signaling pathways. Ceramide
accumulation in AD was first described almost two decades ago, a finding subsequently
confirmed by multiple laboratories. Despite strong evidence implicating impaired ceramide
metabolism with AD, the molecular mechanisms underlying impaired ceramide
homeostasis in the brain remain poorly understood..

We provide novel preliminary data demonstrating that the two classical neuropathological
hallmarks of AD (Aβ and tau pathologies), as well the greatest known AD risk factor (aging),
independently lead to accumulation of brain ceramides, particularly very long chain (VLC)
ceramide species..

The present study examines functional contributions of microglia in host defense,
demyelination, and remyelination following infection of susceptible mice with a neurotropic
coronavirus. Treatment with PLX5622, an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor
(CSF1R) that efficiently depletes microglia, prior to infection of the central nervous
system (CNS) with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) resulted in
increased mortality compared with control mice that correlated with impaired control of
viral replication. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) of CD45+ cells isolated from the
CNS revealed that PLX5622 treatment resulted in muted CD4+ T cell activation profile that
was associated with decreased expression of transcripts encoding MHC class II and CD86 in
macrophages but not dendritic cells. Evaluation of spinal cord demyelination revealed a
marked increase in white matter damage in PLX5622-treated mice that corresponded with
elevated expression of transcripts encoding disease-associated proteins Osteopontin (Spp1),
Apolipoprotein E (Apoe), and Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) that
were enriched within macrophages. In addition, PLX5622 treatment dampened expression of
Cystatin F (Cst7), Insulin growth factor 1 (Igf1), and lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) within
macrophage populations which have been implicated in promoting repair of damaged nerve
tissue and this was associated with impaired remyelination. Collectively, these findings
argue that microglia tailor the CNS microenvironment to enhance control of coronavirus
replication as well as dampen the severity of demyelination and influence repair..

STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS CRANIOTOMY INFECTIONS ALTER GLIAL RESPONSIVENESS
.

Tammy Kielian.


University of Nebraska Medical Center, Pathology and Microbiology, Omaha,
USA
.

Neurosurgery to relieve life-threatening edema (decompressive craniectomy) or gain
temporary access to the brain for tumor resection (craniotomy) requires removal of a portion
of the skull (i.e. bone flap). The incidence of infection after craniotomy/craniectomy
ranges from 1-3%, with approximately half caused by Staphylococcus aureus
(S. aureus), which forms a biofilm on both surfaces of the bone flap.
Biofilms are bacterial communities encased in a self-produced matrix that are recalcitrant
to antibiotics due to their metabolic dormancy. Our laboratory has developed a mouse model
of S. aureus craniotomy-associated biofilm infection that is typified by a
unique immune compartmentalization, namely preferential neutrophil recruitment in the
subcutaneous galea, whereas monocytes are more prominent in the brain parenchyma.
Granulocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs), an immature myeloid population with
anti-inflammatory properties, are present in both compartments, but most abundant in the
galea. This immune profile is associated with bacterial persistence out to 9 months
post-infection, which is reflective of biofilm growth. We have utilized single cell
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to reveal the complex transcriptional heterogeneity of resident
microglia and infiltrating monocytes in the brain in addition to transcriptionally diverse
granulocyte subsets in the subcutaneous galea and bone flap during craniotomy infection. In
the brain, trajectory analysis identified the transition of microglia from a
homeostatic/anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory and proliferative populations. Microglia
augment oxidative metabolism in response to S. aureus biofilm without a
significant increase in glycolysis, which may account for their limited ability to attenuate
S. aureus burden in the brain during craniotomy infection. Analysis of
tissues from patients with craniotomy infection have revealed similar inflammatory
attributes to the mouse model, demonstrating its utility for developing novel therapeutic
strategies. Supported by the NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

The central nervous system is inhabited by a specialized ensemble of myeloid cells that are
highly dynamic and survey their immediate surroundings, which include the parenchyma,
perivascular spaces, pia mater, dura mater, and choroid plexus. These cells are long-lived,
help maintain homeostasis, participate in reparative responses following injury, and protect
the CNS from invading microbes. The CNS is also surveyed and sometimes invaded by
circulating, blood-derived myeloid cells that can contribute to diametrically opposed
outcomes, like vascular breakdown vs. repair, depending on the inflammatory context. This
lecture will focus on recent developments in our understanding of CNS myeloid cells, both
resident and blood-derived. A special emphasis will be placed on how myeloid cells
specifically survey and respond in the meninges vs. brain parenchyma to ward off viral
challenges as well as the imprint left behind long after these pathogens are cleared..

The common protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, exists for the lifetime
of the host within neurons as slow-replicating cysts. Immune deficiency of the host leads to
fatal encephalitis highlighting the requirement for continuous inflammation in the brain for
protection. In the immune-competent host, significant changes in neuro-chemistry are linked
to sub-clinical neuronal pathology, changes in host behavior and enhanced correlations to
neurological disease. The Wilson lab aims to understand the alterations in the infected
brain that could cause enhanced disease susceptibility while ultimately controlling the
resident parasite and inflammatory response. Analysis of gene expression over the course of
infection suggests a stabilization by week 8 with signatures of anti-inflammatory mechanisms
and neuronal repair. An early and consistent component of infection-induced change in the
brain is the presence of reactive astrocytes. Using a novel reporter system for identifying
reactive astrocytes we can demonstrate significant heterogeneity during infection.
Elucidating the function of reactive astrocytes during chronic infection and inflammation
will be critical for our understanding of a balanced and protective immune response in the
brain..

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic and recurrent psychiatric condition
characterized by depressed mood, social isolation and anhedonia. It will affect 20% of
individuals with considerable economic impacts. Unfortunately, 30-50% of depressed
individuals are resistant to current antidepressant treatments. MDD is twice as prevalent in
women and associated symptoms are different. Depression's main environmental risk factor is
chronic stress, and women report higher levels of stress in daily life. However, not every
stressed individual becomes depressed, highlighting the need to identify biological
determinants of stress vulnerability but also resilience. Based on a reverse translational
approach, rodent models of depression were developed to study the mechanisms underlying
susceptibility vs resilience. Indeed, a subpopulation of animals can display coping
mechanisms and a set of biological alterations leading to stress resilience. The etiology of
MDD is multifactorial and involves several physiological systems. Exacerbation of immune
responses from both innate and adaptive systems is observed in depressed individuals and
mice exhibiting depression-like behaviours. Increasing attention has been given to
neurovascular health since higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is found in MDD
patients and inflammatory conditions are associated with depression, treatment resistance
and relapse. I will provide an overview of vascular and immune changes associated with
stress vulnerability vs. resilience in mouse models of depression and MDD patients. Lack of
treatment efficacy suggests that neuron-centric treatments do not address important causal
biological factors and better understanding of stress-induced adaptations, including sex
differences, could contribute to develop novel therapeutic strategies including personalized

SEX SPECIFIC IMMUNE MECHANISMS OF DEPRESSION: TRANSLATING THERAPEUTIC TARGETS

There is a bi-directional relationship between the immune system and major depressive
disorder (MDD). Little is known about mechanisms contributing to the higher incidence of
inflammatory and stress-related illness in females. We used multiplex ELISA to quantify
plasma cytokine protein expression regulated by treatment resistant and non-treatment
resistant depression in men and women compared to age matched (21-55 years) healthy
controlls. To test the ability of mouse stress models to recapitulate the cytokine changes
found in depressed individuals we examined circulating levels of cytokines for male and
female mice exposed to 6-day variable stress and 28-day variable stress. Additional studies
examined cytokine levels following 6 days of variable stress in four-core genotype mice
which allow dissociation of genetic sex from gonadal sex. We found there are sex differences
in the peripheral immune response to MDD or stress that transcend species. Women with
treatment resistant MDD have a sex specific profile of T-cell related immune response
suggestive of an autoimmune disease. Women with treatment resistant depression and men that
are not treatment resistant show activation of cytokines released by the innate immune
system. Rodent stress paradigms also produced a similar pattern for their regulation of
peripheral cytokines. Sex differences in immune profiles were highly dependent on genetic
sex although we did find some effects of gonadal sex in a subset of cytokines. These data
demonstrate that segregation by sex and treatment resistant status are important for
understanding the impact of depression or stress on cytokine profiles in humans and
rodents..

COULD STRESSING OUR GUT MICROBES MAKE US DEPRESSED?
.

Marie-Claude Audet.


University of Ottawa, Nutrition Sciences, Ottawa, Canada
.

Despite the increase of the psychological and economic burden attributable to depressive
illnesses, available pharmacological interventions have variable success rates in reducing
symptoms. The development of effective antidepressant strategies has been limited in part by
our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying depression, especially given that
the illness is heterogeneous. Appreciable evidence suggest that intestinal microbial
communities could play a key role in the pathogenesis of mental illnesses, including
depression. Our work and that of others has shown that in addition to increase
pro-inflammatory cytokines peripherally and centrally, social stressors that elicit
depressive-like states in adult mice disturb the gut microbiota. Using a chronic social
stressor, we reported that long-lasting bacterial changes in male mice were linked to their
susceptibility to the depressive-like effects of the stressor and to brain expression of
pro-inflammatory cytokines. Chronically stressed mice also had long-lasting pro-inflammatory
cytokine elevations in the small intestine, which were accompanied by a decreased expression
of tight junction proteins. In subsequent experiments, we demonstrated that gut microbial
communities and expression of inflammatory and barrier integrity markers along the gut-brain
axis were altered in mouse offspring born to stressed dams, and that changes in abundance of
specific bacteria in humans were related to severity of depressive symptoms only in
individuals that had experienced trauma in their childhood. Although our observations in
mice models and human populations are correlational, they suggest that perturbations of gut
microbial colonization patterns and of inflammatory processes along the gut-brain axis
during development could be key factors in conferring increased risk for depressive
illnesses. In a context where treatments for depression are not optimal, the identification
of early processes that could promote vulnerability to the depressive effects of stressors
could represent a useful tool in the design of interventions to prevent and/or alleviate
depression..

CRITICAL ROLES FOR MICROGLIA DURING CRITICAL PERIODS OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT

Multiple brain regions develop differently in males versus females in response to
testicular steriod synthesis during the perinatal critical period for sexual
differentiation. In the laboratory rat, astrocytes and microglia display sex differences in
morphology, function and number in discrete brain regions. Within the developing medial
amygdala the number of astrocytes surviving to the juvenile period is determined by
microglial mediated phagocytosis, which occurs at significantly higher rates in neonatal
males than females. The reduced number of astrocytes correlates with higher degrees of
neuronal excitation which appears to specifically drive higher rates of rough and tumble
play in young males. In the developing preoptic area, the number of neurons in the sexually
dimorphic nucleus is also controlled by phagocytic activity of microglia, which are also
influenced by immune system mast cells. Overall there is extensive cross talk between
astrocytes, microglia and other immune cells of the brain which direct patterns of
synaptogenesis, cell proliferation and cell survival, thereby altering the developmental
trajectory of the brain distinctly in males and females..

Discussion of our recent characterization of an ultrastructurally distinct microglial
subset that is predominantly associated with pathological states, using a combination of
immunocytochemical electron microscopy, array tomography, and focused-ion beam scanning
electron microscopy with 3D reconstruction. The dark microglia are rare in healthy adult
mice, but they become highly prevalent upon chronic stress, fractalkine signaling deficiency
(CX3CR1 knockouts), aging, and Alzheimer's disease pathology, where they account for
two-thirds of the normal microglial population. These cells display well-characterized
markers of cellular stress, make extensive interactions with synapses and directly ensheath
the basement membrane of capillaries. Recently, we also found evidence that these cells are
similarly abundant during normal brain development, in the first postnatal weeks when
synaptic pruning mainly takes place, and upon exposure to maternal immune activation, where
they display sex differences. We additionally observed these cells in human postmortem brain
samples. Overall, these findings indicate that dark microglia could represent a subset of
cells that become stressed as a result of their hyperactive involvement with the remodeling
of neuronal circuits across development, stress-induced plasticity, aging, and disease
pathology..

Despite increased availability and efficacy of combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART),
people living with HIV (PLWH) experience a constellation of CNS disturbances resulting in
both cognitive and motor dysfunction. The overall prevalence of such symptoms has not
decreased, although the severity has been reduced, and HIV-related dementia is uncommon.
Some clinical studies show significant sex-related differences in types/severity of
behavioral deficits observed in PLWH. Behavioral deficits must involve altered CNS neuronal
function, although neurons themselves are not infected by HIV. Instead, they are bystander
targets of viral toxins or inflammatory factors released by HIV-infected
monocytes/microglia. These in turn affect the function of other glia and neurons, a cascade
of events demonstrated in many culture and animal models. Among the multiple factors
presumably involved in sex-related behavioral differences, we propose a role for
differential glial reactivity and the resulting neuronal damage. We have modeled CNS effects
of HIV using an inducible transgenic mouse expressing the HIV-1 Tat protein. In comparative
studies, Tat+ males display greater deficits in both motor and cognitive/anxiety tests,
although both sexes exhibit some altered behavior over time. After 2-week Tat exposure, male
but not female mice exhibited heightened anxiety, altered fear extinction, and significant
deficits in spatial memory. Related changes were seen in neuronal spine density and synaptic
proteins in critical brain regions, concomitant with altered levels of the
plasticity-related Arc protein. After 3-month exposure, both sexes showed similar reductions
in open field ambulation, but males showed additional motor and anxiety deficits. Although
CNS volumes and total neuron numbers were unchanged, males had higher levels of astrogliosis
and microglial nitrosative stress, as well as more spine reduction and abnormal levels of
excitatory and inhibitory pre- and post-synaptic proteins in some CNS regions. Overall,
increased behavioral deficits in males correlated with more glial activation and synaptic
damage, both of which are implicated in cognitive/motor impairments in patients. Results
suggest that glia in males and females may respond differently to HIV, contributing to
distinct behavioral outcomes between sexes. Support: DA024461/DA044939.

Myelination of central nervous system (CNS) axons enables efficient signal propagation via
saltatory conduction, and it provides metabolic support to ensure axonal integrity. Thus,
the developmental establishment of CNS myelin by a highly specialized cell type, the
oligodendrocyte (OLG), represents a critical component of building a fully functional CNS.
Current models propose that mye-lination can be modulated by axonal electrical activity that
is mediated, at least in part, by vesicular release of the excitatory amino acid glutamate
along unmyelinated axonal segments. While good progress has been made in defining the
effects of axonally released glutamate on progenitor cells of the OLG lineage, much less is
known about the glutamate-responses in differentiating and pre-mye-linating OLGs. We
introduce here, sodium-dependent glutamate transporters as OLG expressed
glutamate-responsive transmembrane proteins modulating CNS myelination. In our earlier
studies, we demonstrated that activation of sodium-dependent glutamate transporters in
differentiating OLGs promotes process outgrowth and branching. This aspect of OLG maturation
is driven by actin cyto-skeleton dynamics, and it is considered a critical step toward the
initiation of CNS myelination. Mechanistically, activation of glutamate transport was found
to initiate a signaling cascade involving reverse mode activation of sodium-calcium exchange
and calcium influx. In continuing studies, we have started to investigate CNS myelination
in vivo in conditional Glt-1 (EAAT2/Slc1a2) knockout
mice and our data, thus far, suggest a developmental effect that may be seen preferentially
in males. Hence, the OLG expressed glutamate transporter GLT-1 emerges as a novel player
modulating CNS mye-lination by a mechanism that controls the morphological changes necessary
for efficient initiation of CNS myelination and that may generate a sexually dimorphic
vulnerability during a critical window of development..

MIMICKING METHAMPHETAMINE USE DISORDER WITH FOOTSHOCK PUNISHMENT: EPIGENETIC AND
TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONSEQUENCES IN THE RAT BRAIN
.

Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is a major public health problem throughout the world.
MUD is associated with severe neuro-psychiatric complications. Investigations that have
focused on the effects of methamphetamine on catecholaminergic systems have not helped to
develop therapeutic agents against MUD. Therefore, we have hypothesized that the
manifestations of MUD may be secondary to perturbations that involve long-lasting
epigenetic, transcriptional, and/or biochemical changes in the brain. Rats were trained to
self-administer methamphetamine over a period of a month. Thereafter, the animals received
contingent shocks while self-administering the drug. Rats were then euthanized and used in
various biochemical, transcriptional, or epigenetic experiments at various timepoints after
withdrawal from methamphetamine self-administration. We measured genome-wide transcriptional
changes using Illumina 22K Rat microarrays. We used a deep sequencing approach with Illumina
HiSeq2500 to identify potential alterations in DNA hydroxymethylation. Rats exposed to
methamphetamine during self-administration experiments escalated their methamphetamine
intake. Contingent shocks separated methamphetamine-exposed rats into punishment-resistant
(PR, addicted) rats that took methamphetamine compulsively and punishment-sensitive
(non-addicted) rats that decreased their lever pressing. Genome-wide DNA sequencing revealed
increased DNA hydroxymethylation of several potassium channels, with PCR showing increased
expression of their mRNAs in the nucleus accumbens of PS rats. Thus, prolonged exposure to
compulsive methamphetamine self-administration in the presence of adverse consequences does
cause long-lasting epigenetic and transcriptional perturbations that could be targeted to
treat MUD. Supported by NIDA Intramural Research Program.

ROLE OF DNA HYDROXYMETHYLATION IN METHAMPHETAMINE ADDICTION
.

Methamphetamine (METH) use disorder (MUD) is a very serious, potentially lethal,
biopsychosocial disease. Exposure to METH causes long-term changes to brain regions involved
in reward processing and motivation, leading vulnerable individuals to engage in
pathological drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior that can remain a lifelong struggle.
According to the U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 375,000 Americans (aged 18-25)
and 1.2 million (aged 26 or older) are active METH users. Despite the widespread use of
METH, much remains to be done to develop effective therapeutic approaches to treat MUD, a
fact that is, in part, related to a relative lack of understanding of the molecular
neurobiology of this brain disease..

Genome-wide analyses such as microarrays and next-generation sequencing following acute and
chronic exposure to METH have demonstrated striking changes in gene expression and
epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that lead to alterations in diverse cellular functions
characteristic of MUD and, ultimately altered behavior. Though understudied, recent
observations have identified METH-induced changes in epigenetic markers including DNA
methylation and histone modifications. Methylation of CpG (5mC ) islands blocks
transcription factor binding, binding of MBD proteins, and recruitment of co-repressor
proteins. These processes result in condensed and transcriptionally repressive chromatin. In
contrast, hydroxymethylation of CpG (5hmC) which is differentially enriched in the brain in
comparison to other tissues has been proposed to promote transcription via DNA
demethylation. We found that METH-addicted rats showed differential DNA hydroxymethylation
in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in comparison to both control and abstinent rats. These
changes occurred mostly at intergenic sites located on long interspersed elements (LINEs).
Moreover, we observed differential DNA hydroxymethylation and increased expression of
specific members of potassium channels in the NAc that may promote abstinence from drug
taking behaviors. These results suggest a potentially novel therapeutic approach to the care
of patients who suffer from methamphetamine use disorder..

NOT ALL STIMULANT DRUGS ARE THE SAME: INSIGHTS FROM HISTONE ACETYLATION AND
DEACETYLATION
.

Veronica Bisagno.


CONICET, ININFA, Buenos Aires, Argentina
.

Psychostimulants produce different behavioral and neurobiological profiles. For example,
some stimulants cause neuroplastic changes leading to addiction and cognitive deficits while
others enhance cognition. Epigenetic mechanisms are known contributory factors to
drug-induced neuroadaptations. These epigenetic changes include dysregulation of histone
deacetylases (HDACs) proposed to participate in maintaining aberrant transcriptional
programs associated with altered cognitive functions and behaviors. We have previously
reported that the psychostimulant drugs modafinil and methamphetamine differentially
influence the acetylation status of histones 3 and 4 at promoters of HDACs in the mouse
prefrontal cortex. HDACs are divided into zinc-dependent [class I (HDAC1,2,3,8), class IIa
(HDAC4,5,7,9), class IIb (HDAC6,10), and class IV (HDAC11)] and NAD-dependent [class III
(sirtuins1-7)] enzymes. Interestingly, class IIa (4, 5, 7, 9) HDACs get phos-phorylated and
exported from the nucleus to cytoplasm after various stimuli. The phosphorylation state of
Class IIa HDACs can impact their enzymatic activity. In this talk, we will present evidence
that psychostimulants (modafinil, methamphetamine and caffeine) differently influence the
expression of Class IIa HDAC in vivo (mouse prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum) and in
vitro (N2a cell line). The differential impact of these psychostimulant drugs on these HDACs
might offer a partial explanation for some of their divergent behavioral effects and
therapeutic profiles. Continued understanding of how psychostimulants drugs alter epigenetic
regulators is essential for identifying transcriptional changes that occur after exposure to
these drugs..

Methamphetamine (METH) addicts lose control over drug consumption despite suffering
multiple adverse consequences. To mimic these negative events, we introduced a rat model of
METH self-administration (SA) with response-contingent punishment. These procedures allowed
us to distinguish between two addiction-like phenotypes in rats, those that sustained METH
SA despite negative consequences (shock-resistant, SR) and rats that significantly reduced
their METH intake (shock-sensitive, SS). Here, we further developed our adverse consequence
model and examining incubation of METH craving by measuring cue-induced drug seeking.
Transcriptional and translational alterations in the striatum were also examined. Male
Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer METH (0.1mg/kg/injection) or saline
intravenously (i.v.) during twenty-two 9-h sessions that consisted of 3 separate 3-h
sessions separated by 30 minutes. Subsequently, rats were subjected to incremental
footshocks during thirteen additional 9-h METH SA sessions. Cue-induced drug craving was
then assessed at 2 and 21 days after the footshock phase. Nine days following the last drug
seeking test, the dorsal striatum was dissected and processed for gene expression and
protein analyses. All rats escalated their METH intake, with both SR and SS phenotypes
showing similar drug taking patterns during SA training. However, SR rats continued their
METH intake despite negative consequences, and showed greater cue-induced drug craving
following withdrawal. PCR arrays revealed significant differences in neurotrophins and their
receptors between the 2 phenotypes. Protein analysis revealed that pTrkA and nerve growth
factor receptor expression were increased only in the SS phenotype. Moreover, SS rats showed
increased abundance of several phos-phorylated proteins known to participate in
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade including cRaf, ERK1/2, MSK1, and CREB. Taken together,
our adverse consequence-based model highlights the possibility of identifying rats by
addiction-like phenotypes, subsequent vulnerability to relapse-like behaviors, and
differential changes in intracellular signaling cascade activated by nerve growth
factor-TrkA/p75NTR interactions..

H-FERRITIN IRON DELIVERY TO OLIGODENDROCYTES AND MYELINATION DURING DEVELOPMENT
.

James Connor, Brian Chiou, Elizabeth Neely, Quinn Wade.


Penn State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, USA
.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency worldwide and affects approximately
one third of infants and children. Iron delivery to the developing brain is essential for
energy and metabolic support needed for processes such as myelination and neuronal
development. It is well-known that oligodendrocytes (OGs) are the highest iron staining
cells in the brain and the ability of these cells to take up a substantial amount of iron
during development is necessary for proper myelination. Inadequate iron delivery frequently
results in severe neurological deficits that are attributed to hypomyelination. Our
laboratory and others have identified H-ferritin (Hft), traditionally considered solely an
iron storage protein, as the primary iron delivery protein to OGs, and this study if the
first to demonstrate Hft delivery during development. We have also identified a novel
receptor on rodent OGs, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein-2 (Tim-2),
that H-ferritin utilizes to act on OGs. In this study, we observed that post-natal day 14
mice have the highest levels of uptake of Hft-bound iron, which reflects the developmental
pattern of myelination and OG maturation. Consistent with these results, we confirmed the
presence of Tim-2 for iron acquisition via extracellular Hft on OGs. Our data indicate that
iron uptake is tightly regulated and suggests that there is a set-point for iron delivery
that is established during development and maintained throughout adulthood. We propose there
is a critical window during which the brain is growing that is amenable to relatively high
levels of iron uptake. The data from this study could have significant implications in the
clinical treatment of brain iron deficiency during development..

MANAGING BRAIN IRON AT THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER
.

Daniel Kosman.


University at Buffalo, Biochemistry, Buffalo, USA

Aqueous Fe2+ is as neurotoxic as it is essential. This ‘yin-yang’ is an integral
part of cerebral iron homeostasis. Key to this homeostasis is the transcellular flux of
ferrous iron across the brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVEC) that establish the
tight junctions characteristic of the brain microvasculature. Elucidation of the
molecular details of this trafficking has lagged behind examination of
the systemic outcomes associated with knockdown of a transporter likely involved in it.
There are three of these proteins: the Zrt-, Irt-like solute uptake transporters, ZIP8 and
ZIP14, and the Fe2+ efflux protein, Ferroportin (FPN). In essentially all these
whole organism KOs, there is dysregulation of cerebral iron metabolism. However, this
experimental paradigm typically can't tease apart the contributors to this pathophysiology,
e.g. is hyper-accumulation due to whole body metal excess, or to a defect
in secretion of abluminal metal back into the circulation. Using a
well-validated blood brain barrier (BBB) model provided by hBMVECs in a transwell culture
dish in which the ECs form a ZO-1/Occludin/Claudin-mediated monolayer that mimics the
barrier properties of brain capillaries. These cells are polarized thus providing a unique
model system in which to examine the following details of this transcellular metal flux.
1) The relative Me2+-uptake activities at the apical and basal
membranes. 2) The relative Me2+-efflux activities from each cell
face. 3) The paracrine signaling between ECs and underlying glia that modulate
these uptake and efflux activities 4) A system in which the trajectory of
Me2+ at the BBB can be quantified. 5) A cell model in which
systematic up-or down-regulation of these uptake and efflux proteins at the plasma membrane
can be correlated quantitatively with changes in the Me2+ flux across this
barrier. In this system, the role of soluble APP (sAPP) in iron trafficking at the BBB also
has been delineated. A survey of key results is presented in this presentation..

Argentina Iron deficiency (ID) represents one of the most prevalent nutritional deficits,
affecting almost two billion people worldwide. Gestational iron deprivation constitutes a
useful experimental model, as it induces hypomyelination due to oligodendroglial immaturity
and thus allows the study of oligodendrocyte (OLG) requirements for progression to a mature
myelinating state. As from gestational day 5, pregnant mice were fed either an ID diet (4mg
iron/kg) or a control diet (40 mg iron/kg), and energy metabolism was assessed in primary
cultures of OLG and astrocytes (AST) from newly born control and ID pups. In particular,
oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates were measured using a Seahorse
extracellular flux analyzer. Neither ID AST nor OLG showed significant differences in
respiration driving ATP synthesis, respiration driving proton leak or non-mitochondrial
respiration as compared to their respective controls. However, they both exhibited decreased
spare respiratory capacity, indicating that maternal ID effectively induces mito-chondrial
dysfunction. Absence of glycogen granules was observed in ID AST and an increase in ROS
production was seen in ID OLG. Mitochondrial fission was increased in ID AST while fusion
was prevalent in ID OLG. Electron microscopy also showed abnormal cristae in ID
mitochondria. These findings further prove that the regulation of cell metabolism may impact
cell fate decisions and maturation..

Biomedical Sciences, Buffalo, USA

Iron is a key nutrient for normal CNS development and function, thus, iron deficiency as
well as iron excess may result in harmful effects in the CNS. Oligodendrocytes and
astrocytes are crucial players in brain iron equilibrium. Oligodendrocytes are the cells
with the highest iron levels in the brain which is linked to their highly metabolic needs
associated with the process of myelination. In contrast, astrocytes do not have a high
metabolic requirement for iron. However, these cells are in close contact with blood vessel
and have a strong iron transport capacity. To study the mechanisms of iron metabolism in
oligodendrocytes and astrocytes we have created several conditional knock-out mice in which
proteins involved in iron uptake, release and storage, such as the divalent metal
transporter 1 (DMT1), the ferritin heavy chain (Fth) and the transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1)
were postnatally ablated specifically in oligo-dendrocytes or astrocytes. To define the
molecular mechanism of iron absorption and storage in oligodendrocytes, we have tested the
function of these proteins in oligodendrocyte iron status and function during brain
development as well as in the cuprizone model of myelin injury and repair. Furthermore, to
stablish the role of astrocytes in brain iron absorption and distribution, the same proteins
were specifically ablated in astrocytes in the postnatal, adult and aging mouse brain. Since
normal CNS iron homeostasis is indispensable for proper oligodendrocyte maturation and
myelination, understanding the molecular mechanisms of iron uptake, storage and efflux in
oligodendrocytes and astrocytes is necessary for planning effective strategies for iron
management during CNS development as well as for the treatment of demyelinating
diseases..

Leukodystrophies constitute a large group of genetic disorders primarily affecting CNS
white matter. Within these, Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC)
is characterized by early-onset macrocephaly, epilepsy and cerebral white matter edema. It
can be caused by mutations in two different genes: MLC1, which is more
frequent, and GLIALCAM. MLC1 is a membrane protein of unknown functions
while GlialCAM is an adhesion molecule that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily.
GlialCAM works as an obligatory subunit of MLC1, being required for MLC1 endo-plasmic
reticulum exit and targeting to astrocyte-astrocyte junctions. In addition, GlialCAM is
further characterized as an auxiliary subunit of the ClC-2 chloride channel, targeting it to
cell-cell junctions and modifying its functional properties. Furthermore, lack of MLC1 and
GlialCAM reduce the current of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). Here, we will
summarized our last findings about the implication of a reduced function of the ClC-2 and
VRAC channels in the pathophysiology of MLC and the way these channels can be regulated..

Stroke with comorbid hypertension (HT) is associated with worsened outcome and not improved
with post-stroke blood pressure (BP) lowering therapies. HT and arteriosclerosis stenosis
are the most significant risk factors for dementia epidemics. However, currently, there are
no therapies for symptomatic treatment of vascular dementia or reducing HT-associated
worsened stroke outcomes. The serine-threonine WNK kinase family [with no lysine (K)], and
its two downstream kinases SPAK (the STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase) and
OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) activate brain
Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) via protein
phosphorylation. Ischemic stroke stimulates the WNK-SPAK kinases-mediated phosphorylation of
NKCC1 protein, which contributes to intracellular Na+ and Cl−
overload, cytotoxic edema, and excitotoxicity ischemic cell damage. Stimulation of brain
WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 complex in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertensive mice led to worsened
ischemic stroke brain damage. Stroke triggered 2-5 fold upregulation of WNK proteins
(isoforms 1, 2, 4), SPAK/OSR1 and NKCC1 proteins in the Ang II-infused hypertensive brains
after stroke, which were located in cortical neurons and associated with nuclear
translocation of phospho-NF-kB protein and increased NF-κB recruitment on Wnk1,
Wnk2, Wnk4, Spak and Nkcc1 gene promoters. Post-stroke
administration of SPAK inhibitor ZT-1a significantly reduced WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 complex
activation, brain lesion, and neurological function deficits in the Ang II hypertensive mice
without lowering BP. We conclude that the Ang II-induced stimulation of NF-kB
transcriptional pathway is involved in upregulating brain WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 cascade and leads
to worsened ischemic stroke outcomes, indicating WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 complex as therapeutic
target for stroke therapy with comorbid HT..

By releasing glutamate, astrocytes actively regulate synaptic transmission and also
contribute to excitotoxicity in neurological diseases. However, the mechanisms of astrocytic
glutamate release have been debated. Here, we report non-vesicular release of glutamate
through the glutamate-permeable volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). Both cell swelling
and receptor stimulation activated astrocytic VRAC, which requires its only obligatory
subunit, Swell1 (a.k.a Lrrc8a). Astrocyte-specific Swell1 knockout mice
exhibited impaired glutamatergic transmission due to the decreases in presynaptic release
probability and ambient glutamate level. Consistently, the mutant mice displayed
hippocampal-dependent learning and memory deficits. During pathological cell swelling,
deletion of astrocytic Swell1 attenuated glutamate-dependent neuronal excitability and
protected mice from brain damage after ischemic stroke. Our identification of a new
molecular mechanism for channel-mediated glutamate release establishes a role for
astrocyte-neuron interactions in both synaptic transmission and brain ischemia. It provides
a rationale for targeting VRAC for the treatment of stroke and other neuro-logical diseases
associated with excitotoxicity..

Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) are a group of ubiquitously expressed ion channels
that are activated by cell swelling and permeable to a variety of negatively charged and
net-neutral molecules. Their broader physiological significance in the brain remains under
investigation. VRACs are formed by the five proteins from the leucine-rich repeat-containing
family 8 (LRRC8A-E), among which LRRC8A is indispensable for channel function. In the recent
work, we established that in brain astrocytes LRRC8 isoforms produce several distinct
heteromeric populations of VRACs, with different permeability for negatively charged and
neutral osmolytes. In order to further explore the physiological roles of VRACs in the
brain, we generated brain-wide knock-out of LRRC8A in neurons, astrocytes, and
oligodendroglia, using Nestin
Cre-targeted Lrrc8a
flox/flox excision. Mice devoid of brain LRRC8A were born close to the expected
Mendelian ratio and developed without overt histological abnormalities. Surprisingly,
>95% of the LRRC8A-null mice died between 5 and 9 weeks of age. All LRRC8A knockouts, but
none of their littermates, displayed a seizure phenotype confirmed by video-EEG recordings.
Immuno-histochemistry and brain slice electrophysiology experiments identified reactive
astrogliosis and disruptions in cell excitability and GABAergic signaling in the hippocampus
of LRRC8A-null mice. We found reductions in total tissue glutamine levels and decreased
immunoreactivity of astrocytic glutamine synthetase, the glutamate transporter GLT-1, and
the GABA transporter GAT-1. Together, these findings suggest that VRAC provides vital
control of brain excitability in mouse adolescence. VRAC deletion leads to a lethal
phenotype involving progressive astrogliosis and hyperexcitability linked to dysregulation
of astrocytic uptake and supply of amino acid neurotransmitters and their precursors..

RETINAL INPUTS SIGNAL ASTROCYTES TO RECRUIT INTERNEURONS INTO VISUAL THALAMUS
.

Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC, Department of Biological Sciences,
Roanoke, United States
.

Inhibitory interneurons comprise a fraction of the total neurons in visual thalamus but are
essential for sharpening receptive field properties and improving contrast-gain of
retinogeniculate transmission. During early development, these interneurons undergo
long-range migration from germinal zones, a process regulated by the innervation of visual
thalamus by retinal ganglion cells. Here, using transcriptomic approaches, we identified a
motogenic cue, Fibroblast Growth Factor 15 (FGF15), whose expression in visual thalamus is
regulated by retinal input. Targeted deletion of functional FGF15 in mice led to a reduction
in thalamic GABAergic interneurons similar to that observed in the absence of retinal input.
This loss may be attributed, at least in part, to misrouting of interneurons into non-visual
thalamic nuclei. Unexpectedly, expression analysis revealed that FGF15 is generated by
thalamic astrocytes and not retino-recipient neurons. Thus, these data show that retinal
inputs signal through astrocytes to direct the long-range recruitment of interneurons into
visual thalamus..

ASTROCYTE MODULATION OF CELL-TYPE SPECIFIC SYNAPTIC ORGANIZATION MEDIATED BY SONIC
HEDGEHOG SIGNALING
.

A. Denise Garcia.


Drexel University, Biology, Philadelphia, USA
.

Astrocytes are essential elements in the structural and functional properties of synapses.
The molecular signaling mechanisms mediating reciprocal neuron-astrocyte interactions remain
poorly understood. In the postnatal and adult mammalian forebrain, the molecular signaling
pathway, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is actively transduced by discrete subpopulations of
astrocytes. Shh signaling is initiated by neurons which produce SHH, leading to
transcription of SHH target genes, including the transcription factor, Gli1. Though best
understood for its prominent roles in embryonic neurodevelopment, the functional
significance of SHH-mediated neuron-astrocyte interactions remain poorly defined. To address
this question, we performed targeted disruption of Shh signaling selectively in astrocytes
and examined structural and functional properties of cortical neurons in postnatal and adult
brains. Mutant mice exhibited an elevated density of dendritic spines in cortical neurons.
Interestingly, these phenotypes were observed selectively in layer V cortical neurons, where
Gli1 astrocytes are abundant, but not in layer II cortical neurons, where few Gli1
astrocytes are found. The increase in spine density emerges during adolescence and persists
into adulthood, and arises from prolonged stability of individual spines, as observed by
chronic, in vivo imaging by 2P LSM. These structural phenotypes are
accompanied by aberrant neuronal activity that is associated with a pronounced reduction in
expression of Kir4.1, a glial-specific, inward rectifying K+ channel. Kir4.1 is
essential for maintaining K+ homeostasis and limiting neuronal activity,
suggesting that astrocyte modulation of neuronal activity is a necessary component of
establishing the mature neuronal circuit. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that
Shh-mediated reciprocal interactions between neurons and astrocytes during neural circuit
development play a key role in establishing and maintaining appropriate synaptic
connectivity..

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a critical growth factor involved in the
maturation of the CNS, including neuronal morphology and synapse refinement. Herein, we
demonstrate astrocytes express high levels of BDNF's receptor, TrkB (in the top 20 of
protein-coding transcripts), with nearly exclusive expression of the truncated isoform,
TrkB.T1, which peaks in expression during astro-cyte morphological maturation. Using a novel
culture paradigm, we show that astrocyte morphological complexity is increased in the
presence of BDNF and is dependent upon BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling. Deletion of TrkB.T1, globally
and astrocyte-specifically, in mice revealed morphologically immature astrocytes with
significantly reduced volume, as well as dysregulated expression of perisynaptic genes
associated with mature astrocyte function. Indicating a role for functional astrocyte
maturation via BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling, TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes do not support normal
excitatory synaptogenesis or function. These data suggest a significant role for
BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling in astrocyte morphological maturation, a critical process for CNS
development..

Astrocytes are implicated in synapse formation, maturation and elimination that are
associated with developmental refinements of neuronal circuits and synaptic plasticity that
underlie learning and memory. Astrocyte dysfunctions are also linked to synapse pathologies
that lead to imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) synaptic activity and are
associated with several neurologic disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and
epilepsy. EphB receptor/ephrin-B signaling is among several mechanisms implicated in
synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Our recent work suggests its new role in
glial-neuronal interactions that may influence both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We
hypothesized that astro-cytic ephrin-B1 may affect synapse formation in the developing
hippocampus by influencing trans-synaptic interactions between neu-ronal ephrins and EphB
receptors. Using a loss-of-function and a gain-of function approach we showed that
astrocytic ephrin-B1 negatively regulates excitatory synapse formation in the hippo-campus
during early postnatal day (P) 14-P28 development. A higher number of dendritic spines and
enhanced evoked AMPAR and NMDAR excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) most likely
contributed to enhanced excitation of CA1 pyramidal neurons in astro-cyte-specific ephrin-B1
knock-out (KO) mice. In contrast, EPSCs were reduced in CA1 neurons neighboring ephrin-B1
overexpressing (OE) astrocytes. Our studies also implicate astrocytic ephrin-B1 in the
development of inhibitory circuits in the hippocampus. Evoked inhibitory postsynaptic
currents (IPSC) were reduced in CA1 neurons of P14-28 KO mice, most likely due to reduced
number inhibitory synapses on CA1 neurons and impaired maturation of parvalbumin
(PV)-expressing inhibitory interneurons. In contrast, astrocyte-specific ephrin-B1 OE
increased the number of PV-expressing cells. Astrocyte-specific ephrin-B1 deletion also led
to a significant down-regulation of the gene expression associated with astrocyte/microglia
reactivity and oligodendrocyte differentiation, but an increased expression of genes
associated with excitatory synaptogenesis and neuronal hyperexcitability. The dysregulation
of excitatory/inhibitory (E/ I) balance induced by the astrocyte-specific deletion of
ephrin-B1 in developing hippocampus was most likely responsible for enhanced susceptibility
to seizures, impaired sociability and increased repetitive behaviors observed in these mice.
The ability of astrocytic ephrin-B1 influence both excitatory and inhibitory circuits during
development can potentially contribute to developmental refinement of neuronal circuits..

HIGHLY SELECTIVE A3 ADENOSINE RECEPTOR AGONISTS AS NON-NARCOTIC ANALGESICS FOR
NEUROPATHIC PAIN
.

Chronic neuropathic pain affects 15-20 millions of individuals in the US alone. Neuropathic
pain conditions are chronic, often severe, debilitating and exceedingly difficult to treat.
Current treatments provide moderate pain relief and have many side effects as exemplified by
the use of opioids. There is an urgent need to identify therapeutic targets based on new
mechanisms. The purine nucleoside adenosine has long been known to exert potent
antinociceptive effects in numerous preclinical models. In human proof-of-principle studies,
adenosine has been reported to promote potent analgesia in patients with neuropathic pain.
However, the use of adenosine in the treatment of neuropathic pain is limited by its very
short half-life and severe cardiovascular side effects due to activation of the A1 and A2A
adenosine receptor subtypes (A1AR; A2AAR). Up until recently, the dogma has been that
adenosine's effects are mediated by its actions at A1AR, and maybe at the A2AAR. However,
targeting the A1AR or A2AAR failed as a therapeutic approach because of the severe
cardiovascular side effects resulting from activating these receptor subtypes. Over the last
several years, we have discovered that the analgesic effects of adenosine are not only
mediated by A1AR or A2AR but also by the A3AR. Our work in this area for the last decade
validated the A3AR as a target for therapeutic intervention with A3AR agonists and led to
the identification of highly selective A3AR agonists that were used to probe the roles of
the ade-nosine-A3AR axis in pain. I will describe the pharmacological profile of selective
A3AR agonists in preclinical models of neuropathic pain in rodents and discuss molecular and
biochemical signaling pathways engaged downstream of A3AR activation. Noteworthy, highly
selective A3AR agonists are now in clinical development as novel non-narcotic
analgesics..

UNLOCKING NAV1.7'S PAIN POTENTIAL
.

Rajesh Khanna.


University of Arizona, Pharmacology, Tucson, USA

NaV1.7 is a key ion channel in pain signaling. Gain-of-function mutations in the human
NaV1.7 gene produce sensory neurons hyperexcitability associated with severe pain; whereas
loss-of-function mutations generate congenital insensibility to pain syndromes. However,
efforts to develop NaV1.7 inhibitors for pain therapeutics have consistently failed.
Post-translational modifications of NaVs and/or auxiliary subunits and protein-protein
interactions have been reported as NaV-trafficking mechanisms. We recently reported that
modification of the axonal collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) by a small
ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) controls both trafficking and currents of NaV1.7 (Dustrude
et al., J. Biol. Chem. 288: 24316-31 (2013)).
Capitalizing on this unique pathway for NaV1.7 regulation, Regulonix Holding Inc. identified
compounds by computationally docking 50,000 small molecules to a pocket encompassing the
residue SUMOylated (K374) in CRMP2. These compounds were designed to inhibit the
E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9-CRMP2 interaction, which, in turn, would block CRMP2 from being
SUMOylated by Ubc9. Among the over 266 compounds identified in this manner, several
(i) exhibited superb inhibition of the Ubc9-CRMP2 interaction,
(ii) bound to CRMP2 - but not Ubc9, and notably, (iii)
did not affect any other CRMP2-mediated functions, including facilitation of neurite
outgrowth, ability to bind to protein partners (tubulin, N-type voltage-gated calcium
(CaV2.2), and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)), and ability to regulate CaV2.2
activity. Superb anti-allodynic activities without loss of motoric performance or
sympathetic side effects were observed for several compounds. Furthermore, animal
pharmacological studies indicated that some of the compounds displayed extended duration of
action (2–16-fold) compared with morphine upon intrathecal administration to rats.
Additional studies demonstrated inhibition of NaV1.7 currents in human and porcine sensory
neurons, thus increasing likelihood of translational success and ‘de-risking’ compound
selection. Thus, we advance an innovative approach by focusing on a unique mechanism of
action of the compounds that involves an indirect targeting to control surface expression
and activity of the NaV1.7 channel..

Aberrant increases in NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling contributes to central nervous system
sensitization and chronic pain by activating the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase
(nNOS) and generating the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO). The scaffolding protein
postsynaptic density 95kDA (PSD95) tethers nNOS to NMDARs. Consequently, the PSD95-nNOS
complex represents a therapeutic target. We hypothesized that disruption of the
protein-protein interface between PSD95 and nNOS would suppress NMDAR-dependent pathological
states without unwanted side-effects of NMDAR antagonists. The small molecule PSD95-nNOS
inhibitor IC87201 and a related analog, ZL006, inhibited binding of purified PSD95 and nNOS
proteins in AlphaScreen without altering binding of PSD95 to an unrelated protein, ErbB4.
Both PSD95-nNOS inhibitors also suppressed glutamate-induced cell death with efficacy
comparable to the NMDAR antagonist MK-801. IC87201 and ZL006 produced antinociception in
multiple models of inflammatory pain and also suppressed formalin-evoked Fos protein
expression in rat lumbar spinal cord. IC87201 and ZL006 also suppressed allodynia induced by
the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel with efficacy similar to MK-801. MK-801 also impaired
both memory and motor functions, which were not inhibited by ZL006 and IC87201 under similar
conditions. Neither IC87201 nor ZL006 produced reward or aversion in a conditioned place
preference (CPP) assay. However, both ligands blocked CPP to morphine. The PSD95-nNOS
inhibitor also suppresses morphine-induced dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens shell.
Collectively, our results demonstrate that disrupting PSD95-nNOS protein-protein
interactions is effective in attenuating pathological pain without producing unwanted side
effects (i.e. motor ataxia, reward) associated with NMDAR antagonists. Supported by

Opioid-induced alterations in sphingolipid metabolism in the spinal cord and increased
formation of the bioactive sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are
implicated in the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH; increased pain
sensitivity) and analgesic tolerance. These opioid-induced adverse effects hamper opioid use
for treating chronic pain and can contribute to dependence and abuse. S1P produces distinct
effects through five G protein-coupled receptors (S1PR1-5) and several intracellular
targets. We now report that S1P contributes to the development of OIH, tolerance and
dependence through S1P1 receptor subtype 1 (S1PR1) signaling and blocking S1PR1 with S1PR1
antagonists attenuated these opioid-induced adverse behaviors. Targeting S1PR1 reduced
opioid-induced neuroinflammation that included reducing glial activity, nuclear factor κB
and mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 signaling activation and inflammatory cytokine
expression, such as interleukin-1β, while increasing IL-10 expression. Our findings identify
S1PR1 as a critical path for S1P signaling in response to sustained morphine and reveal
downstream neuroinflammatory pathways impacted by S1PR1 activation. Our work supports
investigating S1PR1 antagonists as a clinical approach to mitigate opioid-induced adverse
effects and the repurposing of the functional S1PR1 antagonist FTY720, which is already
FDA-approved for multiple sclerosis, as an opioid adjunct..

AXON-MYELIN PROTECTION AND PLASTICITY IN TRAUMATIC WHITE MATTER INJURY
.

Regina Armstrong.


USUHS, Anatomy, Physiology & Genetics, Bethesda, USA
.

Long axons in white matter tracts are particularly vulnerable to the forces from traumatic
brain injury (TBI). The subsequent trajectory of recovery versus progression of white matter
pathology is a key feature underlying neurodegeneration among patients who experience
persistent symptoms after TBI. Importantly, the dynamic interactions between damaged axons
and ensheathing myelin open opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions that are being
explored in pre-clinical models. Using a mouse model of concussive TBI, our studies identify
a progression of both myelinated axon conduction deficits and axon-myelin pathology in the
corpus callosum, implicating white matter injury in impaired information processing, which
is common in TBI patients. Partial recovery during the subacute phase reveals a potential
therapeutic window associated with remyelination. However, with longer time post-TBI,
atrophy of the corpus callosum indicates progression to chronic stage pathology. To test
mechanisms to mitigate white matter injury after TBI, we examined the role of SARM1 protein
that is essential for execution of the conserved axon death pathway. Neuropathological
analysis of mice with Sarm1 gene deletion (Sarm1-/-)
versus wild type (Sarm1+/+) littermates showed that loss of
Sarm1 reduces axon damage, demyelination and white matter atrophy after
TBI. Longitudinal MRI studies of live mice detected significant corpus callosum atrophy
after TBI in Sarm1+/+ mice that was attenuated in
Sarm1-/-mice. Furthermore, at this chronic phase post-injury,
Sarm1+/+ mice exhibited functional deficits in Miss-step wheel running
and sleep behavior that were not present in Sarm1-/-mice. These studies
underscore the role of SARM1 in white matter injury after TBI, and provide evidence for TBI
as a potential clinical indication for therapeutics targeting this axon degeneration
pathway..

REPAIR AND RESTORATION OF THE CEREBROVASCULATURE FOLLOWING TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY:
THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS
.

Andre Obenaus.


University of California Irvine, Pediatrics, Irvine, USA
.

Cerebral vascular injury is a defining feature of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) which
leads to secondary injury and influences clinical outcomes. There is an urgent need to
develop new therapies to repair and restore cerebral vessels. We previously reported that
TBI leads to an immediate and early loss of vessels at the injury site and vascular
abnormalities adjacent to the TBI. Without therapeutic intervention we observed that vessels
attempt to repair and restore vascular function to the injured brain. Interestingly, we
reported that increased b-catenin and Wnt expression in cerebral vessels which coincides
with vascular repair after brain injury. Wnt/b-catenin signaling promotes blood vessel
formation during embryonic development, but its role in vascular repair after TBI remains
unclear. Ongoing studies demonstrate that we can enhance or retard vascular repair and
thereby modulating vascular function using a range of pharmacological and small molecule
compounds. In mice the restored vasculature of showed increased branching and elongated
vessels that coincided with a reduction in hemorrhage. Our findings suggest that
Wnt/b-catenin signaling becomes activated after TBI to promote vascular repair thus
providing a potential target for future therapeutic intervention..

OLIGODENDROCYTES

Rutgers University, Biological Sciences, Newark, USA

Myelin loss in brain is a common occurrence in traumatic brain injury (TBI) that results
from impact-induced acceleration forces to the head. Fast and abrupt head motions, either
resulting from violent blows and/or jolts, cause rapid stretching of the brain tissue, and
the long axons within the white matter tracts are especially vulnerable to such mechanical
strain. Recent studies have shown that mechanotransduction plays an important role in
regulating oligo-dendrocyte progenitors cell differentiation into oligodendrocytes. However,
little is known about the impact of mechanical strain on mature oligodendrocytes and the
stability of their associated myelin sheaths. We used an in vitro cellular
stretch device to address these questions, as well as characterize a mechanotransduction
mechanism that mediates oligodendrocytes’ responses. Mechanical stretch caused myelin
protein loss in oligodendrocytes. Cell death was not observed. Myelin protein loss was
accompanied by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and Erk1/2 activation. Chelating
Ca2+ or inhibiting Erk1/2 activation was sufficient to block the
stretch-induced loss of myelin protein. Further biochemical analyses revealed that the
stretch-induced myelin protein loss was mediated by the release of Ca2+ from the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequent Ca2+-dependent activation of Erk1/2.
Altogether, our findings characterize an Erk1/2-dependent mechanotransduction mechanism in
mature oligo-dendrocytes that de-stabilizes the myelination program..

LIF COUNTERPOSES TRAUMATIC WHITE MATTER INJURY AND PRESERVES SENSORIMOTOR
FUNCTION
.

Steven Levison.


Rutgers University, Pharmacology, Physiology & Neuroscience, Newark,
USA
.

Cytokines and growth factors are key candidates for mediating the changes induced by damage
to the brain as they can affect astrocyte proliferation, microglial activation and cell
survival. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the interleukin-6-type cytokine
family, is rapidly induced after CNS injury and participates in all of these processes. We
have compared the extent of damage to subcortical white matter in LIF heterozygous (LIF-H)
and wild type (WT) mice using a model of mild traumatic brain injury. In WT juvenile mice
LIF transcripts increased ∼15 fold 24 hours following a closed head injury accompanied by
both astroglial and microglial activation. LIF-H mice had decreased astrocyte activation and
a blunted microglial response. Over time, the WT mice recovered whereas damage increased and
subsequently neurological function diminished in the LIF-H mice. As LIF deficiency was
detrimental to recovery, we asked whether elevating brain levels of LIF would be beneficial.
Therefore, we administered recombinant LIF to wild type mice intranasally either at 4 hours
or at 3 days after injury. LIF was administered twice per day for 3 days. Intranasal LIF
decreased astroglial activation, reduced axonal damage, preserved numbers of
oligodendrocytes and corpus callosum white matter and improved sensorimotor function
compared to vehicle treated injured mice. These data support the view that LIF functions as
an important trophic cytokine in the CNS and that sustaining levels of LIF during the
subacute phase after injury will improve neurological function. Supported by grant #

NEURAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE PROSOCIAL EFFECTS OF MDMA

Robert Malenka.


Stanford, Psychiatry, Stanford, USA

Positive prosocial interactions contribute to the development and maintenance of a range of
adaptive, cooperative behaviors. Conversely, inability to participate in normal social
interactions is a debilitating symptom of several prominent neuropsychiatric disorders.
Although the role of neuromodulators in social behaviors is an active area of investigation,
relatively little is known about the detailed neural mechanisms that influence sociability.
This talk will review evidence that release of serotonin in the nucleus accumbens plays a
critical role in promoting sociability. Deficits in the action of serotonin in the nucleus
accumbens may contribute to sociability deficits in mouse models of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD). Consistent with this hypothesis, administration of MDMA enhances sociability in both
wildtype and ASD mice due to its serotonin-releasing properties in the nucleus
accumbens..

UNTANGLING KETAMINE'S ANTIDEPRESSANT CIRCUITRY THROUGH PARALLEL HUMAN AND MOUSE
EXPERIMENTS
.

Boris Heifets.

& Pain Medicine, Stanford, USA
.

Ketamine (KET), one of our oldest anesthetic agents, has found new life as a rapid-acting
antidepressant. Its profound psychoactive effects and use as a psychotherapeutic adjunct
have drawn comparisons with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, another promising strategy
for the rapid treatment of depression. While KET appears to have significant therapeutic
potential, scaling its use for millions of patients is limited by its well-known abuse
potential, short duration of effect, and toxicity associated with chronic high dose use.
Developing safer, better KET-like drugs requires a clear understanding of KET's mechanism.
Despite early enthusiasm for N-Methyl D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonism as KET's
primary antidepressant mechanism, multiple failed clinical trials of other NMDAR antagonists
suggest this account is incomplete. Recent work has broadened possible explanations for
KET's anti-depressant mechanism to include a multiplicity of low-affinity molecular targets,
challenging the usefulness of a traditional molecular pharmacology approach..

In this presentation, I will show parallel mouse and human experiments that describe the
distributed ensemble of neural activity that may define KET's antidepressant effect. We
recently found that KET's antidepressant effect is completely blocked by pretreating
depressed patients with naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist. Using this key insight,
we have mapped opioid-receptor dependent KET effects across the entire rodent brain. We have
combined whole brain clearing methods and light sheet imaging with a genetically modified
mouse line in which a fluorescent reporter gene is selectively transcribed only in neurons
that are active during a drug experience. Comparing brain-wide unbiased “ensemble” maps
generated by KET versus KET+naltrexone, we have identified several cortical and subcortical
areas that may be sufficient to drive ketamine's antidepressant response. I will also
describe our work testing the role of conscious subjective awareness during KET infusion for
the induction of KET's antidepressant effect. Our preliminary data from depressed patients
presenting for noncardiac surgery indicates that KET delivered during general anesthesia
maintains its antidepressant efficacy, and acute KET-associated EEG responses may predict
the clinical response..

IMAGING THE RAPID AND LONG-LASTING ACTIONS OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS: FROM KETAMINE TO
PSILOCYBIN

Yale University, Psychiatry, New Haven, USA

Pilot studies have hinted that serotonergic psychedelics such as psilocybin may relieve
depression, and could possibly do so by promoting neural plasticity. Intriguingly, another
psychotomimetic compound, ketamine, is a fast-acting antidepressant and induces synapse
formation. The similarities in behavioral and neural effects have been puzzling because the
compounds target distinct molecular receptors in the brain. In this talk, I will discuss
recent work on determining the actions of ketamine and psilocybin on cortical neurons in
mice. In particular, I will describe a series of studies using subcellular-resolution
optical microscopy to dissect the impact of these compounds on dendritic structure and
dendritic calcium signaling. Based on these results, I will summarize by proposing a
framework based on dendritic excitability that may underlie ketamine and psilocybin's
capacities to promote neural plasticity..

Neural plasticity—broadly defined as the ability of the brain to change and adapt—is of
fundamental importance to a properly functioning nervous system. It is the basis for
learning and memory and enables our brains to recover from the pathological changes that
underlie neuropsychiatric diseases such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and
substance use disorder. Recently, our group discovered that psychedelic natural products and
related compounds, such as LSD, DMT, and ibogaine, rapidly promote structural and functional
neural plasticity in rodents. These compounds are capable of re-wiring neural circuitry to
produce long-lasting antidepressant, anxiolytic, and anti-addictive behavioral responses.
Psychedelics have inspired our total synthesis and medicinal chemistry efforts to develop
safer and more effective neurotherapeutics, and they serve as key chemical tools in our
studies to understand the fundamental bio-chemical mechanisms that give rise to neural
plasticity..

DYNAMICS BETWEEN EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES AND AMYLOID-Β PROTEIN
.

Michael Nichols.


University of Missouri - St. Louis, Chemistry & Biochemistry, St. Louis,
USA
.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are class of cell-secreted particles that include microvesicle
(MV) and exosome subgroups. These cargo-holding vesicles mediate cell-to-cell communication
and appear to be linked in some way with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alz-heimer's
disease (AD). Both the smaller exosomes (10-100 nm diameter) and the larger MVs
(100 nm-1 µm) have been shown to carry amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins as part of their
cargo, and their levels are elevated in AD. However, less is known about the specific
mechanisms of EVs in AD. The rational for the studies described herein comes from longtime
observations of microglial cell clustering around neuritic Aβ plaques in AD brains. Due to
their close proximity, it is reasonable to imagine that there may be processes linking
microglia, EVs and Aβ..

Multiple strategies were used to characterize MVs released from microglia after ATP
stimulation. Confocal microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron
microscopy revealed a polydis-perse population of small spherical structures ranging in size
(diameter) from 150-600 nm but centering around 300-350 nm. Using a fluorescently-labeled
membrane insertion probe, MVs were tracked in several different assays. This method, along
with an Aβ ELISA, allowed demonstration of a strong interaction between MVs and
oligomeric/protofibrillar Aβ. MVs had much less interaction with monomeric Aβ, yet displayed
an inhibitory effect on Aβ monomer aggregation. An additional pathway of EV/Aβ interaction
was characterized that involved trafficking of Aβ into MVs by microglia. Primary microglia
rapidly internalized Aβ protofibrils, compartmentalized the protein aggregates into MVs, and
released these Aβ-containing MVs after stimulation of the microglia with ATP. Further EV/Aβ
interactions remain to be investigated, including differences between EV subtypes and a
better understanding of the role of EVs in neurodegenerative and inflammatory processes..

Background: Neuronal and astrocytic-derived Extracellular Vesicles (NEVs and
AEVs) can be isolated from blood with immuno-precipitation against neuronal/glial proteins.
NEV cargo provides diverse Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, including Abeta42, total and
phospho-Tau, insulin signaling mediators, synaptic proteins, cellular stress response factor
REST, lysosomal enzymes, and mtRNAs. In a large case control study based on Baltimore
Longitudinal Study of Aging participants, NEV biomarkers predicted future AD diagnosis with
∼90% area-under-curve (AUC), and>80% sensitivity and specificity. AEV AD biomarkers
include potentially neurotoxic complement proteins. Methods: We follow a
two-step methodology, isolating total EVs from plasma through particle precipitation, then,
NEVs or AEVs through immunoprecipitation against neuronal L1CAM or astrocytic GLAST. A
second validation study of NEV biomarkers for AD prediction was based on 292 serum samples
from 146 Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's prevention (WRAP) participants, divided into
longitudinal cognitive decliners and stable participants. To study functional effects of
circulating EVs, we co-cultured AEVs and NEVs with rat cortical and human iPSC-derived
neurons and performed cell viability and neurodegeneration assays. Results:
Biomarkers: Decliners had higher levels of p231Tau and t-Tau, and lower ratios of
p231-TaU/t-Tau and p181Tau/t-Tau (all p<0.01) compared to stable individuals; a model
combining longitudinal NEV biomarkers achieved ∼94 % AUC, with high sensitivity and
specificity for predicting cognitive decline. Functional assays: AEVs (and, less
effectively, NEVs) of AD participants induced Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) expression on
recipient neurons, membrane disruption, neurodegeneration with reduced neurite density, and
decreased cell viability. Neurodegenerative effects were not produced by total EVs from the
same AD participants or AEVs/NEVs from FTLD or control participants, and were suppressed by
the MAC inhibitor CD59. Conclusions: NEV biomarkers can predict cognitive
decline in late middle age and, perhaps, diagnose preclinical AD. Circulating AEV/NEV can
induce neurodegeneration, which depends on MAC deposition. Inhibition of EV-associated
complement components may be therapeutically beneficial in AD..

THE ROLE OF THE CERAMIDE TRANSFER PROTEIN (CERTL) IN NEURO-INFLAMMATION IN ALZHEIMER'S
DISEASE

Pilar Martinez-Martinez.


Maastricht University, Neuroscience, Maastricht, Netherlands

Ceramide and sphingomyelin (SM) are sphingolipids, important for cell membrane structure
and cell biology. In the brain tissue of Alz-heimer's disease (AD) patients, levels of
certain ceramide species are elevated, whilst other sphingolipids like SM are decreased.
Ceramide transfer proteins (CERTs) are the only known ceramide carriers, crucial for
ceramide and SM regulation. Blockage of CERTs ceramide transfer activity leads to reduced
levels of SM in vitro. Moreover, besides their ceramide transfer function,
CERT proteins are also able to activate the complement system and co-localize with amyloid-β
(Aβ) plaques in the AD brain. To date, the significance of these observations to the
pathophysiology of AD remained uncertain. We will illustrate novel mechanism of action of
CERT, and highlight its role in abeta homeostasis, neuro-inflammation and lipid levels in
the brain. Based on these novel observations new research pathways will be revealed for
identifying therapeutic targets of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases..

ABETA-ASSOCIATED EXOSOMES FROM ASTROCYTES DRIVE AMYLOID PATHOLOGY IN ALZHEIMER'S
DISEASE

University of Kentucky, Department of Physiology, Kentucky, USA
.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by build-up of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) and
phosphorylated tau. However, amyloid plaque and tau tangle formation are often not directly
correlated with neuro-toxicity and cognitive decline. We proposed an alternative mechanism
implying an unknown but critical factor that mediates neuro-toxicity of amyloid and tau. We
first focused on amyloid toxicity and discovered that Aβ associates with astrocyte-derived
and ceramide-enriched lipid vesicles (exosomes) we termed astrosomes. Aβ-associated
astrosomes nucleate amyloid plaques in the 5xFAD mouse, a model for familial AD. We also
showed that pharmacological inhibition of ceramide generation reduced plaque formation and
improved cognition, indicating that Aβ association to astrosomes is a critical factor in AD
pathology. Our current research shows that association of Aβ to astrosomes is not only
critical for amyloid plaque nucleation, but also for Aβ neurotoxicity. We found that
Aβ-associated astrosomes induce mitochondrial damage and caspase 3 activation in neurons at
an Aβ concentration several orders of magnitude lower than what was previously reported to
be neurotoxic. Currently, we investigate the molecular mechanism underlying mito-toxicity of
Aβ-associated astrosomes and therapeutic strategies targeting ceramide to protect neurons in
AD. This work is supported by grants NIH R01AG034389 and R01NS095215, and VA 1 I01

DISEASE-RELEVANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HUMAN AND MOUSE ASTROCYTES

Astrocytes are critical for the development, function, and homeo-stasis of the central
nervous system. In a range of diseases and injuries, astrocytes undergo reactive with both
beneficial and detrimental effects depending on the disease context. However, most of our
knowledge of reactive astrocytes has been obtained from mouse studies. Our understanding of
astrocyte biology in humans remains in its infancy. Previous methods to purify primary human
astrocytes requires culturing in serum, blood components that induce reactive astrogliosis
in injury and disease. We recently developed an immunopanning method to purify human
astrocytes and a serum-free culturing condition that maintains primary human astrocytes at
resting state..

Here, we used this method to purify primary human and mouse astro-cytes and compared their
responses to four types of disease-relevant perturbations: oxidative stress, inflammatory
cytokine TNFa treatment, hypoxia, and poly I:C treatment which mimics viral infection. We
found that human astrocytes are more susceptible to oxidative stress compared to mouse
astrocytes. To determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the differences in
oxidative stress susceptibility between human and mouse astrocytes, we performed
mitochondria respiration assays. We found that mouse astrocytes exhibit higher rate of
mitochondria respiration than human astro-cytes, thus producing more reactive oxygen species
(ROS). We found that mouse astrocytes developed adaptive advantages in ROS detoxification
pathways compared to human astrocytes, including (1) higher rate of oxidation at
peroxisomes, an organelle involved in ROS detoxification, (2) higher expression of catalase,
an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide, and (3) higher expression of
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, which
generates NADPH that neutralizes ROS. We also found that TNFa, hypoxia, and poly I:C
treatments induced different molecular responses in human vs mouse astrocytes. For example,
TNFa induced cellular senescence pathway in human but not mouse astrocytes. These
differences may contribute to differences between mouse models and human patients with
neuro-logical disorders..

PROTECTIVE ROLES FOR ASTROCYTIC CELL DEATH SIGNALING DURING CNS VIRAL INFECTION
.

Programmed cell death (PCD) is a key feature of the innate immune response to viral
infection, as it both limits replicative niches for viruses and instructs subsequent
antiviral immunity. How-ever, programmed cell death is also a hallmark of immunopathology
and may represent a maladaptive strategy for pathogen control in nonregenerative tissues
such as the central nervous system (CNS). Necroptosis is an immunogenic form of PCD that is
induced via activation of receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3). Engagement of RIPK3
activity in neurons can induce inflammatory gene transcription in the absence of cell death,
demonstrating specialized adaptation of this pathway in neural cells. However, potential
specialized responses for this pathway in glial cells have not yet been described. Here, we
demonstrate that engagement of the necroptotic kinase RIPK3 during Zika virus infection
drives neuroin-flammatory astrocyte activation and restricts viral replication without
inducing necroptotic cell death. Using mouse models of viral encephalitis, we show that
astrocytic RIPK3 signaling is required to limit CNS viral burden, promote protective
neuroinflammation, and ensure host survival. These effects were associated with the
RIPK3-dependent induction of a neuroinflammatory astrocytic trans-criptional program. These
data identify previously unknown, death-independent functions for RIPK3 in astrocytes, key
cellular mediators of neuroimmunological responses to infection..

THE ASTROCYTE IMMUNOPROTEASOME MEDIATES PROTECTION DURING CHRONIC CNS
AUTOIMMUNITY
.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the CNS for
which there is a critical need for therapeutic intervention, specifically in patients with
chronic, progressive disease. During MS pathogenesis, multiple inflammatory mediators
including reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause oxidative stress and damage
intracellular proteins, and interferon (IFN)g, which is known to enhance inflammation in
early disease stages, are present. Astrocytes in and around MS lesions are critical for the
maintenance of homeostasis and are responsive to many inflammatory mediators during
neuroinflammation, including IFNg. Paradoxically, IFNg also has protective functions during
chronic stages of CNS autoimmunity. Analyzing astrocytes in postmortem human tissue
specimens from patients with chronic MS, we found that an IFNg-stimulated protein complex,
the immunoproteasome (iP), is upregulated in specific CNS regions and that iP expression
corresponded with a reduction in oxidative stress. We confirmed that iP expression was
stimulated by IFNg in regional primary adult human astrocytes and that specific inhibition
of the iP using ONX 0914 following IFNg stimulation resulted in increased ROS, an
accumulation of oxidatively damaged proteins, and enhanced caspase-3- mediated cell death.
In a murine model of chronic MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), ONX 0914
treatment led to exacerbated disease and increased lesion size, astrocyte oxidative stress
and poly-ubiquitinated protein accumulation. Similarly, mice with a conditional deletion of
IFNgR on astrocytes had a reduction in astrocyte iP expression and exhibited exacerbated EAE
with increased lesion size, and evidence of enhanced oxidative stress and poly-ubiquitinated
protein accumulation in astrocytes compared to littermate controls. Taken together, our data
suggest for the first time that IFNg signaling in astrocytes upregulates the iP with
regional specificity and has a novel role in contributing to CNS homeostasis by reducing ROS
and degrading damaged poly-ubiquitinated proteins during chronic neuroinflammation.
Understanding the role of the astrocyte iP and further dissecting the protective functions
of IFNg during chronic neuroinflammation may lead to development of novel targets for
treatment of progressive MS..

ASTROCYTIC MITOCHONDRIAL TRANSFER REGULATES NEURONAL SURVIVAL AND PLASTICITY AFTER
STROKE
.

Massachusetts General Hospital, Radiology, Charlestown, USA

Recently, it was suggested that neurons can release and transfer damaged mitochondria to
astrocytes for disposal and recycling. This ability of brain cells to exchange mitochondria
may represent a new paradigm for cell-cell signaling in the central nervous system (CNS).
Here, we show that astrocytes can also release functional mito-chondria that enter into
neurons. Astrocytic release of extracellular mitochondria was mediated by a
calcium-dependent mechanism involving CD38/cyclic ADP ribose signaling. Transient focal
cerebral ischemia in mice induced astrocytic mitochondria entry to adjacent neurons that
amplified cell survival signals. Suppression of CD38 signaling with siRNA reduced
extracellular mitochondria transfer and worsened neurological outcomes. These findings
suggest a new mitochondrial mechanism of neuroglial crosstalk that may underlie endogenous
neuroprotective mechanisms after stroke..

Remyelination represents an unmet need in multiple sclerosis therapy. High-throughput
screens conducted in recent years have validated a diverse range of FDA-approved drugs and
small mole-cules that promote oligodendrocyte formation from oligodendrocyte progenitor
cells. Recently we reported that dozens of small molecules that enhance oligodendrocyte
formation share the ability to inhibit a narrow range of steps in cholesterol biosynthesis.
By inhibiting enzymes between CYP51 and EBP, these molecules cause the cellular accumulation
of specific 8,9-unsaturated sterols, which are sufficient to promote oligodendrocyte
formation when supplied in purified form. These studies suggest novel druggable targets and
lead molecules to accelerate the development of the first remyelinating therapeutics..

CHEMISTRY-BASED METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING BINDING SITES FOR STEROID MODULATORS OF ION
CHANNELS

The endogenous neurosteroid allopregnanolone (AlloP) is a positive allosteric modulator
(PAM) of γ-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABA-A) receptors. AlloP and analogues of this
neurosteroid are of therapeutic interest for the treatment of clinical depression and other
medical conditions. Identification of amino acids at putative binding sites for AlloP on
GABA-A receptors and other ion channels has been achieved using molecular biology methods.
However, much remains to be learned about the molecular details of neurosteroid interactions
with the sites thus far identified. In this regard, photoaffinity labeling of these sites by
neurosteroid analogues provides information about the location, orientation and number of
binding sites for neurosteroids on these receptors. Such information is useful for the
design of new drugs that act at these sites. Photoaffinity labeling when combined with click
chemistry (click photolabels) provides an enhanced ability to obtain this information using
mass spectrometry and molecular modeling. Additionally, click photolabels also are useful
for identifying binding sites that may not yet have been detected by site-directed
mutagenesis studies. This presentation will discuss results obtained with neurosteroid click
photolabels for GABA-A receptors. This work was supported by NIH grants GM108799 and The

The accumulation of protein aggregates is a hallmark of most neurodegenerative diseases. To
counteract protein aggregation cells utilize an array of pathways including molecular
chaperones that refold misfolded proteins, and ubiquitination enzymes that target misfolded
proteins for degradation. One E3 ligase, C-terminus of Hsc70 Interacting Protein (CHIP),
sits at the interface of protein folding and protein degradation. CHIP functions by binding
molecular chaperones and E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes to facilitate the ubiquitination
and subsequent degradation of chaperone client proteins. The clearance of these chaperone
bound client proteins prevents the toxic accumulation of misfolded proteins. The removal of
these toxic proteins by CHIP is neuroprotective. Consistent with this, increasing CHIP
levels is neuroprotective in models of neuro-degenerative diseases, and decreasing levels of
CHIP accelerates phenotypes associated with neurodegeneration. Based on these observations
we hypothesized that small molecules that increase CHIP activity may be protective. Here we
will discuss our efforts to develop small molecules that regulate CHIP activity..

In neurological diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the failure to repair
demyelinated lesions contributes to axonal damage and clinical disability. We provide
evidence that Mertk, a gene highly expressed by microglia that alters MS
risk, is required for efficient remyelination. Compared to WT mice, Mertk-KO mice show
impaired clearance of myelin debris and remyelination following demyelination. Using
single-cell RNA-sequencing, we characterize Mertk-influenced responses to
cuprizone-mediated demyelination and remyelination across different cell types. Mertk-KO
brains show an attenuated microglial response to demyelination, but an elevated proportion
of interferon-responsive microglia. In addition, we identify a transcriptionally-distinct
subtype of oligodendrocytes specific to demyelinated lesions. The inhibitory effect of
myelin debris on remyelination is mediated in part by IFNγ, which further impedes microglial
clearance of myelin debris and inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation. Together, our work
establishes a role for Mertk in microglia activation, phagocytosis, and
migration during the remye-lination process and identifies a new mechanism for myelin debris
inhibiting remyelination..

Enteric glia are the largest population of glial cells outside the brain yet their
phenotypic diversity, normal functions, and roles in disease are not well understood. In
order to investigate enteric glial functions in vivo, previous studies
targeted cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for genetic ablation in
mice. These studies found that enteric glia are essential for the regulation of intestinal
epithelial barrier integrity and epithelial cell proliferation, and that glial dysfunction
causes intestinal inflammation. While only a subset of enteric glia expresses GFAP,
virtually all express proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1). We used the PLP1 promoter to drive
expression of diphtheria toxin subunit A (DTA) in enteric glia and discovered that these
cells are not essential for maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity or
epithelial cell proliferation in vivo, contrary to long-standing beliefs.
Using PLP1-DTA mice to probe glial functions in vivo, we are uncovering
unexpected roles for enteric glia in many aspects of gut homeostasis, from motility to host
defense..

Gone are the days when enteric glial cells (EGC) were considered merely as satellites of
enteric neurons. Like their brain counterpart astrocytes, EGC express an impressive number
of receptors for neurotransmitters and intercellular messengers, thereby contributing to
neuroprotection and to the regulation of neuronal activity. EGC also produce different
soluble factors that regulate neighboring cells among which are intestinal epithelial cells.
A better understanding of EGC response to an inflammatory environment, often referred to as
enteric glial reactivity, could help define the physiological role of EGC and the importance
of this reactivity in maintaining gut functions. In chronic inflammatory disorders of the
gut such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), EGC exhibit abnormal phenotype
and their neighboring cells are dysfunctional, but it remains unclear whether EGC are only
passive bystanders or active players in the pathophysiology of both disorders. The aim of
the current presentation is to review the physiological roles and properties of EGC, their
response to inflammation, their role in the regulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier
and to discuss the emerging concept of CD as being an enteric gliopathy..

The intestinal lining is the largest surface where the body meets the outside world and its
proper functioning is important for gastroin-testinal health and overall well-being. Gut
epithelium is controlled by extrinsic innervation and the enteric nervous system, an
intricate network of neurons and glial cells residing in the gut wall. Enteric glia
contribute to the acute regulation of gut reflexes such as motility and secretomotor
functions, but their role in the intestinal epithelial barrier is unclear. While in vitro
studies have demonstrated direct glial effects on the epithelial cells, different animal
models of glial ablation have shown that enteric glia are either required or dispensable for
epithelial barrier function. We found that enteric glia do not acutely regulate epithelial
barrier in healthy mouse colon and hypothesized that enteric glia contribute to gut
inflammation which may induce persistent gut dysfunction. Enteric glia express adenosine A2B
receptors (A2BRs), but their function is not understood. We used Sox10
CreERT2+/ ;Adora2b
f/f mice to ablate glial A2BRs and assessed the effects of acute colitis using 2%
dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Weight loss, macroscopic tissue damage, and the infiltration
of CD45+ cells at the level of the myenteric plexus were comparable between
Sox10
CreERT2+/–;Adora2b
f/f mice and littermate controls (Adora2b
f/f). Colonic permeability was increased during the resolution of colitis in
Adora2b
f/f animals compared to their healthy controls and Sox10
CreERT2+/–;Adora2b
f/f mice. DSS colitis induced persistent changes in the expression of tight
junction protein transcripts and the loss of glial A2BRs normalized the expression of
Claudin-1. The ablation of glial A2BRs protected against increases in proinflammatory
mediators such as eotaxin-1, G-CSF, IL-1a, IP-10, KC, and MIG during acute colitis, and
protected against changes in eotaxin-1, KC, IL-12(p40), and IL-17 during resolution. In
conclusion, glial A2BR signaling modulates immune responses during acute colitis and its
effects on downstream mechanisms may contribute to persistent gut epithelial barrier
dysfunction..

Astrocytes have a prominent role in metabolic homeostasis of the brain and can signal to
adjacent neurons by releasing glutamate via a process of regulated exocytosis. Astrocytes
synthesize glutamate de novo owing to pyruvate entry to the
citric/tricarboxylic acid cycle via pyruvate carboxylase, an astrocyte specific enzyme.
Pyruvate can be sourced from two metabolic fuels, glucose and lactate. Thus, we investigated
the role of these energy/carbon sources in exocytotic glutamate release from astrocytes.
Purified astrocyte cultures were acutely incubated (1 hour) in glucose and/or
lactate-containing media. Astrocytes were mechanically stimulated, a procedure known to
increase intracellular Ca2+ levels and cause exocytotic glutamate release, the
dynamics of which were monitored using single cell fluo-rescence microscopy. Our data
indicate that glucose, either taken-up from media or mobilized from the glycogen storage,
sustained glutamate release, while the availability of lactate significantly reduced the
release of glutamate from astrocytes. Based on further pharma-cological manipulation during
imaging along with tandem mass spectrometry (proteomics) analysis, lactate alone, but not in
hybrid fuel, caused metabolic changes consistent with an increased synthesis of fatty acids.
Proteomics analysis further unveiled complex changes in protein profiles, which were
condition-dependent and generally included changes in levels of cytoskeletal proteins,
proteins of secretory organelle/vesicle traffic and recycling at the plasma mem-brane in
aglycemic, lactate or hybrid-fueled astrocytes. These findings support the notion that the
availability of energy sources and metabolic milieu play a significant role in
gliotransmission..

Astrocytes tile the central nervous system and are widely implicated in brain diseases, but
the molecular mechanisms by which astrocytes contribute to brain disorders remain
incompletely explored. By performing astrocyte gene expression analyses following 14
experimental perturbations of relevance to the striatum, we discovered that striatal
astrocytes mount highly context-specific molecular responses. Through data mining, we also
identified astrocyte pathways in Huntington's disease (HD) that were reciprocally altered
with respect to the activation of striatal astrocyte G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)
signaling. Furthermore, selective striatal astrocyte stimulation of the Gi-GPCR
pathway in vivo corrected several HD-associated astrocytic, synaptic, and
behavioural phenotypes with accompanying improvement of HD-associated astrocyte signaling
pathways. Overall, our data show that astrocytes are malleable, utilising context-specific
responses that can be dissected molecularly and used for phenotypic benefit in brain
disorders..

GLIAL AUTOPHAGY IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE

Glia are fundamental players in the nervous system and contribute to neuronal development,
function, and degeneration. Our previous study implicated that neuronal auxilin
(aux), a clathrin-uncoating factor and homolog of Cyclin-G-associated
kinase (GAK), is a causative factor of Parkinson's disease (PD) using
Drosophila as a model. Despite its prevalent expression in glia, whether
glial GAK/ aux contributes to neurodegeneration remains elusive. Here we
present evidence that glial GAK/aux is a new player in autophagy.
aux contributes to PD via regulating glial autophagic clearance
independent of its clathrin-uncoating activity. Downregulation of aux
expression in glia specifically induces age-dependent lysosome and autophagosome
accumulation, leading to impaired autophagic flux, autophagosome-lysosome fusion defects,
and accumulation of auto-phagic substrate p62. Downregulation of GAK
expression in immortalized microglial cells causes similar lysosome and auto-phagosome
defects. Pathologically, downregulating glial aux expression results in
age-dependent locomotor deficits, DA neuron loss, and shortened lifespan, all
neurodegenerative phenotypes associated with PD. Taken together, our findings reveal that
GAK/aux regulates autophagic degradation in glia, a possible route for
clearing unwanted neuronal aggregates associated with neurodegeneration, demonstrating the
importance of glia-neuron interaction during both normal and pathological conditions..

Neuronal activity is closely modulated by changes in astrocytic structures and functions,
or astrocytic plasticity. Recently, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) has emerged as a
critical component in the structural and functional plasticity of astrocytes. However, the
mechanisms underlying GFAP-modulating astrocytic plasticity remain poorly understood. Here,
using interactions between astro-cytes and magnocellular neuroendocrine neurons in rat
supraoptic nucleus as a model, we studied how GFAP modulates astrocyte morphology and
functions under suckling stimulation or osmotic challenges. The results showed that dynamic
changes in GFAP filaments in astrocytes are accompanied by synchronous change in the spatial
location of other membrane proteins, such as aquaporin 4 (AQP4), synaptobrevin or VAMP, and
volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). This GFAP plasticity is related to actin filament
reorganization. Moreover, GFAP retraction is accompanied with increased molecular
association between GFAP and action, particularly at somata and proximal processes. The
extension of GFAP filaments requires the pulling of actin filaments at peripheral end of
astrocyte processes as well as the volume expansion at the processes. The later effect
requires normal functions of AQP4 and VRAC. Hence, changes in GFAP and other functional
proteins in astrocytes may play a role of guiding the spatial localization of various
functional proteins in cytoplasmic transportion and mem-brane protein cycling..

Myelin is about 70% lipid, thus the ability of oligodendrocytes to manufacture lipids is
key for myelination. In many tissues, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs)
are master regulators that initiate transcription of lipid enzymes and ultimately synthesis
of cholesterol and fatty acids. When sterol levels are low, SREBPs in precursor form are
transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi to release the cleaved form which
then translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription. We have shown in
vitro that SREBP activation is required for oligodendrocyte maturation, including
process extension and myelin protein expression. In vivo, deletion of the
SCAP gene, which transports SREBP to the golgi for cleavage, results in lack of myelination
however, studies have shown that astrocytes are able to donate
cholesterol and other sterols to oligo-dendrocytes. The necessity of SREBP for myelination
suggests that pathological conditions that involve loss of SREBP cleavage and transport to
the nucleus would affect differentiation of oligodendro-cytes progenitors. Our laboratory
studies the white matter loss seen in HIV+ individuals who have HIV-associated
neurocognitive disorder (HAND), even when their viral load is well-controlled by
anti-retrovirals (ARVs). Thus, the ARVs themselves may play a role in the myelin deficits.
In fact, the amount of white matter loss can be correlated with the amount of time on ARVs
and a transcriptomic comparison of HAND+ individuals with or without ARVs shows that some
myelin transcripts remain dysregulated even with ARV treatment. One major side effect of
select ARV drugs is lipid dysregulation, including SREBP alterations, but this has not been
studied in oligodendrocytes or in the CNS. Our studies on oligodendrocytes show that SREBP
regulation is a target for these antiretrovirals and is one of the cellular processes
dysregulated by select ART agents, thus likely compromising myelination..

PEROXISOMAL METABOLISM AND CNS MYELINATION: INSIGHTS INTO ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY FROM A

Peroxisomal metabolism is essential to myelin turnover and maintenance, and disorders of
peroxisomal function have characteristic severe white matter lesions of the nervous system.
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), the most common peroxisomal disorder, is caused by
mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter D1 (ABCD1) gene. X-ALD is
characterized by substantial phenotype heterogeneity, ranging from the peripheral dying back
axonopathy that affects adults, known as adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), to a severe cerebral
inflammatory demyelinating form affecting boys during childhood (cALD). ABCD1 is involved in
the import of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) into the peroxisome for their
degradation. VLCFAs, including both saturated and monounsaturated forms, are highly enriched
in myelin. While VLCFAs are a sensitive biomarker for X-ALD, they do not predict AMN versus
cALD phenotype, and in fact studies have shown that correction of VLCFA levels failed to
protect against disease progression. X-ALD lacks treatment and the current mouse model only
partially recapitulates phenotypes. We have generated ABCD1 mutants in the small vertebrate
model system zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish ABCD1 mutants have elevated
VLCFA levels; abnormal patterning and decreased numbers of oligodendrocytes with increased
cell death in the CNS; hypomyelination in the spinal cord; and impaired motor function.
Induction of human ABCD1 expression in oligodendro-cytes reduced embryonic apoptosis of
these cells and improved motor function. We have developed a novel approach to discover
therapeutics. Because zebrafish are small, develop quickly and are inexpensive, we are using
them in a high throughput screen based on impaired motor behavior, to identify compounds
that could rescue the myelination defect. The antimalarial, FDA-approved compound
chloroquine has been identified from the behavioral screen. Chloroquine induces the
expression of SCD1, shifting saturated VLCFA towards monounsaturated VLCFA and that strategy
could be beneficial in X-ALD. Overall, the zebrafish model of X-ALD can provide relevant
insights for additional work on X-ALD patho-genesis, and can lead to future clinical
trials..

SUBCELLULAR DIVERSION OF CHOLESTEROL BY NEUROPATHY-LINKED MUTATIONS IN PMP22
.

Univ. of Florida Neuroscience Dept., McKnight Brain Institute, Gainesville,
USA
.

Abnormalities in lipid metabolism have been linked with hypomye-linating and de-myelinating
neuropathies, indicating a critical role for cholesterol in myelin synthesis by
oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. In this study, we examined the subcellular trafficking
of choles-terol in models of hereditary neuropathies associated with misex-pression of
peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). Previous studies in Schwann cells lacking PMP22
indicate alterations in cholesterol metabolism, which is associated with severe
hypomyelination of peripheral nerves. Since overproduction of wild type (WT) and mutated
forms of PMP22 also cause peripheral nerve pathology with myelin defects, we examined
cholesterol metabolism in tissues and cells modeling these forms of neuropathy. In samples
from homozygous Trembler J (TrJ) mice carrying a Leu16Pro mutation in PMP22, cholesterol was
retained in the Golgi compartment..

Overproduction of the WT protein, which models Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A)
neuropathies, triggered cholesterol sequestration to lysosomes and reduction of ATP-binding
cassette transporter (ABCA1) -dependent cholesterol efflux. Conversely, lysosomal targeting
of cholesterol by 1-2.5 µM U18666A treatment increased WT-PMP22 levels in lysosomes.
Mutagenesis of a choles-terol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) sequence, or
CRAC-domain, in human PMP22 lead to increased levels of PMP22 in the ER and Golgi
compartments, along with higher cytosolic, and lower membrane-associated cholesterol.
Importantly, cholesterol trafficking defects observed in PMP22-deficient Schwann cells were
rescued by reintroduction of the WT-but not the CRAC-mutant-PMP22. We also observed that
myelination deficits in dorsal root ganglia explants from heterozygous PMP22-deficient mice
were improved by choles-terol supplementation. Collectively, these findings indicate that
PMP22 is critical in cholesterol metabolism, and this mechanism is likely a contributing
factor in PMP22-linked hereditary demye-linating neuropathies..

NORADRENERGIC REGULATION OF GLIAL ACTIVATION: RELEVANCE TO AD AND MS?
.

Douglas Feinstein.


University of Illinois, Dept. Anesthesiology, Chicago, USA
.

Aside from its role as a neurotransmitter, noradrenaline (NA) has other functions in the
CNS. This includes restricting development of inflammatory activation, providing
neurotrophic support to neurons, and providing neuroprotection against oxidative stress. In
vitro studies have shown that NA regulates proinflammatory activation of glial cells,
mediated in part through suppression of the NFkB signaling pathway. In recent years, it has
become evident that dysregulation of NA levels or signaling contributes to a variety of
neurological diseases and conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Multiple
Sclerosis (MS). The basis for dysregulation in these diseases is often due to damage
occurring to noradrenergic neurons present in the locus coeruleus (LC), the major source of
NA in the CNS. LC damage is present in AD, MS, and a number of other diseases and
conditions. In mouse models of AD, experimental lesion of the LC leads to increases in
neuropathology and amyloid plaque burden, while treatment with drugs to increase NA or
reduce LC damage reduce plaque burden. LC damage is also present in the EAE mouse model of
MS, and raising NA levels reduces disease severity and inflammatory activation. Further
understanding of these events will be of value for the development of treatments for AD,
multiple sclerosis, and other diseases and conditions having a neuroinflammatory
component..

ASTROCYTES INTEGRATE LOCAL SENSORY AND BRAIN-WIDE NEUROMODULATORY SIGNALS IN THE MOUSE
VISUAL CORTEX
.

Matthew Holt.


VIB, VIB-KU Leuven Center for Brain and Disease Research, Leuven, Belgium
.

Astrocytes play multiple functions in the central nervous system (CNS), from control of
blood flow through to modulation of synaptic activity. Data from ex vivo
experiments have suggested that transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ are key
to controlling these functions. Paradoxically, responses to sensory stimuli recorded
in vivo are usually weak and unreliable..

In this talk, I will present evidence suggesting that astrocytes in mouse visual cortex are
primed to respond to local neuronal activity by the neuromodulator norepinephrine, released
during heightened arousal. Primed astrocytes respond to neuronal activity, elicited by
complex visual stimuli, in a classical retinotopic pattern. Hence, under physiological
conditions, astrocyte activity is dependent on the integration of information across
signaling modalities. Such activity adds an unexpected layer of complexity to astrocyte
function and may enable astrocytes to specifically and subtly regulate local network
activity and plasticity..

Astrocytes under stimulation exhibit predominantly glycolytic metabolism with lactate as
the end glycolytic product despite the normal oxygen levels (i.e. aerobic
glycolysis). Aerobic glycolysis in astrocytes is activated through astroglial surface
receptors, including adrenergic receptors, coupled to calcium and/or cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways each contributing to astroglial glucose metabolism.
Upon noradrenergic stimulation lactate produced in aerobic glycolysis is released from
astrocytes and can be used as a neuronal fuel or acts as a signal in the brain. Recent
studies suggested that astrocytes express low levels of the lactate GPR81 receptor that is
in fat cells part of an autocrine loop, in which the Gi-protein mediates
reduction of cAMP. Whether extracellular lactate as a signal affects brain metabolism, in
particular astroglial metabolism, is unclear. We measured the cytosolic levels of cAMP,
calcium, glucose, and lactate in single isolated astrocytes using fluo-rescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET)-based nanosensors. In contrast to fat cells, in astrocytes
stimulation by extracellular lactate and the selective GPR81 agonists, like adrenergic
stimulation, elevated intracellular cAMP and lactate, which was reduced by the inhibition of
adenylate cyclase. GPR81 agonists increased cytosolic cAMP also in GPR81-knock out
astrocytes, suggesting that the lactate effect is GPR81-independent and mediated by an
alternative receptor-like mechanism that enhances aerobic glycolysis and lactate production
via a positive feedback mechanism..

A tight metabolic coupling between astrocytes and neurons is a key feature of brain energy
metabolism (Magistretti and Allaman, Neuron, 2015). Two basic mechanisms of neurometabolic
coupling between neurons and astrocytes have been decribed : the glycogenolytic effect of
VIP and of noradrenaline and the glutamate-stimulated aerobic glycolysis. Both mechanism of
neuron-astrocyte metabolic coupling result in the release of lactate from astrocytes as an
energy substrate for neurons (Magistretti and Allaman, Neuron, 2015; Magistretti and
Allaman, Nat Neurosci Rev, 2018). L-Lactate is not only an energy substrate but also a
signaling molecule for long-term memory consolidation and for maintenance of LTP (Suzuki et
al, Cell, 2011). Beta-2 adrenergic receptor activation selectively located on astrocytes and
resulting in glycogenolysis trigger this lactate-mediated effect on plasticity and memory
(Gao et al, PNAS, 2016). L-lactate stimulates the expression of synaptic plasticity-related
genes such as Arc, Zif268 and BDNF through a mechanism
involving NMDA receptor activity and its downstream signaling cascade Erk1/ 2 (Yang et al,
PNAS, 2014). A transcriptome analysis in cortical neurons has shown that the expression of a
total of 20 genes is modulated by L-Lactate; of these, 16 involved in plasticity and
neuroprotection are upregulated and 4 involved in cell death are downregulated (Margineanu
et al. Front. Mol Neurosci, 2018). This set of results reveal a novel action of L-lactate as
a signaling mole-cule in addition to its role as an energy substrate (Magistretti and
Allaman, Nat Neurosci Rev, 2018). These actions of L-Lactate are also relevant for animal
models of neuropsychiatric disorders. Indeed we have shown that peripheral administration of
lactate exerts anti-depressant-like effects in three animal models of depression (Carrard et
al, Mol.Psy., 2016). Finally, we have shown that the transfer of L-Lactate from astrocytes
to neurons plays a key role in an appetitive memory task involving the basolateral amygdala
such as cocaine place preference in mice (Boury-Jamot et al. Mol Psy, 2016)..

During aging, the function and resilience of neurons declines at different rates in
different parts of the brain. The causes of this variability in neuronal susceptibility
during aging are not known. Microglia support tissue homeostasis, modulate synaptic
connections between neurons, and produce inflammatory factors, all of which can shape
cognitive decline and disease susceptibility. Within the basal ganglia, a collection of deep
brain nuclei that regulate movement and key forms of learning, we found that microglia in
young adult mice exhibit striking regional differences in basic properties and functional
states, raising the possibility that microglial capacity to shape neuronal health and
synaptic function throughout the lifespan varies. In particular, microglia in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of young adult mice showed
distinct cellular phenotypes compared to their counterparts elsewhere. During aging, we
found that VTA/SNc microglia begin to proliferate months before microglia in other brain
regions. These increases in resident microglia were associated with elevation in local
levels of inflammatory factors, generating “pockets” of inflammation in the VTA/SNc as early
as late middle age, which may profoundly impact surrounding dopamine neurons. We are
currently using molecular, electrophysiological, and advanced imaging approaches to identify
factors that underlie this premature VTA/SNc microglial aging and to define its impact on
surrounding neurons. The aim of these studies is to identify strategies for modulating
microglial phenotype to preserve the health of vulnerable populations of neurons within the
brain..

MICROGLIA REGULATE SYNAPTIC FORMATION, NEURONAL ACTIVITY, AND LOCAL
SYNCHRONIZATION
.

Microglia constantly move their processes in the brain in vivo suggesting
their surveillance of local brain structures. We attempted to understand the functional
significance of this dynamic motility of microglial processes. First, we focused on the
prima facie interaction between microglia and neurons in vivo. Microglial
processes selectively and regularly contacted onto synapses in the adult mouse cortex (Wake
et al. 2009). Excitatory synaptic transmission was facilitated during microglial contact,
but this was diminished by systemic LPS injection. In addition, the synchronous activity of
neurons within the local cortical area was disrupted by both microglial ablation and LPS
injection (Akiyoshi et al 2018). This finding suggests that microglial contact onto synapses
not only modulates synaptic transmission, but also contributes to the generation of
synchronicity of local cortical circuit activity. When we next examined the damaged brain,
microglial contact onto synapses was more prolonged in duration and was frequently
associated with the elimination of synapses (Wake et al 2009). In addition, microglia tended
to extend their processes toward neuronal elements exhibiting damage and this appeared to
rescue neurons by facilitating the suppression of neuronal excitotoxicity (Kato et al.
2016). On the other hand, in our examination of the immature brain, microglial contact onto
neuronal dendrites induced the generation of synapses and cortical circuits (Miyamoto et al
2016). Thus, microglia adapt their modulatory action on neurons depending on the specific
brain environment..

ELUCIDATING NICHE-ASSOCIATED FUNCTION OF MICROGLIA BY LEVERAGING THE MOUSE
RETINA

A macrophage niche is not simply a location within a given tissue where these phagocytes
reside or accumulate. Rather, it is a local system in which the microenvironment regulates
the fate and function of these macrophages and in turn helps meet the dynamic needs of that
tissue in health or disease. Elucidation of macrophage function in the context of its niche
is a robust means to investigate the biology or pathobiology of a given tissue and how
macrophages are contributing to it. However, very little is known in this regard. I will
present how our lab has been leveraging scRNA-Seq of the mouse retina to identify
niche-associated populations of microglia. I will also share our most recent work, which is
defining the subretinal space in context of being an inducible microglial niche during
retinal degeneration and explain what this novel concept is revealing about disease..

NEURONAL ACTIVITY CONTROLS MICROGLIAL PROCESS DYNAMICS IN AWAKE MICE

Microglia are resident immune cells that dynamically survey the brain parenchyma.
Microglial processes interact with neuronal dendrites; however, the role that neuronal
network activity plays in regulating microglial dynamics is not entirely clear. Most studies
of microglial dynamics have either utilized slice preparations or in vivo imaging in the
anesthetized mice. Here we demonstrate that microglia in the awake mice survey a small
territory and exhibit stunted process dynamics. By contrast, reduced neuronal activity under
general anesthesia greatly increases microglial process extension and the area of territory
surveyed. Similarly, reduction of local neuronal activity via sensory deprivation or
optogenetic inhibition increases microglial process surveillance. Using pharmacological and
chemogenetic approaches, we demonstrate that reduced norepinephrine signaling is necessary
for the observed increases in microglial process surveillance. Thus, our results demonstrate
that noradrenergic tone in the awake mice normally suppresses microglial process
surveillance under basal physiological conditions. Our results therefore indicate the
importance of awake imaging for studying microglia-neuron interactions and advance a “set
point” theory for how neuronal activity influences microglial process dynamics..

MODULATING PROTEOLIPID PROTEIN AS A THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY FOR PELIZAEUS-MERZBACHER
DISEASE

Mutations in proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) result in
failure of mye-lination and severe neurological dysfunction in the X-linked pediatric
leukodystrophy Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). Most PLP1 variants,
including supernumerary copies and various point mutations, are fatal. However,
PLP1-null patients and mice display comparatively mild phenotypes,
suggesting that reduction of aberrant PLP1 expression might provide a
universal therapeutic strategy across PMD genotypes. Here we show effective in
vivo suppression of Plp1 in the severe jimpy
(Plp1jp) point mutation mouse model of PMD. CRISPR-Cas9
mediated germline knockdown of Plp1 in jimpy mice
increased myelinating oligodendrocytes and restored nerve conduction velocity, motor
function, and lifespan to wild-type levels, thereby validating PLP1
suppression as a therapeutic approach. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of
Plp1 suppression in postnatal PMD mice, we tested antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs) that stably decrease mouse Plp1 mRNA and protein
in vivo in the central nervous system. Administration of a single
intraventricular dose of Plp1-targeted ASOs to postnatal
jimpy mice increased myelination, improved motor behavior, and extended
lifespan through an 8-month endpoint. Collectively, these results support the development of
PLP1 suppression as a disease-modifying therapy for PMD. More broadly, we
demonstrate that oligonucleotide therapeutics can be delivered to oligodendrocytes
in vivo to modulate neurological function and lifespan, opening a new
treatment modality for myelin disorders..

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an acquired inflammatory demyelinating disorder associated with
neurodegeneration. Cortical demyelination plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the
progressive form of MS, leading to physical and cognitive disability and brain atrophy.
Although the cortex is capable of spontaneous remyelination in both multiple sclerosis and
the cuprizone model of demyelination in mice, it is unknown whether the pattern of cortical
myelination is re-established following injury. To determine the specificity of cortical
myelin repair, we longitudinally monitored individual oligodendro-cytes and their myelin
sheaths using in vivo two-photon microscopy in adult MOBP-EGFP mice given a cuprizone diet.
This approach offers new opportunities for defining the mechanisms of oligo-dendrogenesis
and axon recognition after myelin loss, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of potential
therapeutics in vivo..

Mutations occurring in the cytoskeletal gene TUBB4A (tubulin beta 4A) leads to a range of
neurological disorders. Majority of the population is affected from Hypomyelinating Atrophy
of Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum (H-ABC), a rare leukodystrophy resulting from the recurring
mutation p. Asp249Asn (D249N) in TUBB4Agene. Patients exhibit dystonia,
gait impairment and cognitive deficits due to loss of neurons and myelin in the basal
ganglia and cerebellum. We have developed a novel knock-in mouse model harboring
heterozygous (Tubb4aD249N/+) and the homozygous
(Tubb4a
D249N/D249N
) mutation that recapitulates the progressive motor dysfunction with tremor, dystonia
and ataxia seen in H-ABC. Tubb4a
D249N/D249N
mice have myelination deficits along with dramatic decrease in mature oligodendrocytes
and their progenitor cells. Additionally, a significant loss occurs in the cerebellar
granular neurons and striatal neurons in Tubb4a
D249N/D249N
mice. In vitro studies show decreased survival and dysfunction in
microtubule dynamics in neurons from Tubb4a
D249N/D249N
mice. Thus Tubb4a
D249N/D249N
mice demon-strate the complex cellular physiology of H-ABC, likely due to independent
effects on oligodendrocytes, striatal neurons, and cerebellar granule cells in the context
of altered microtubule dynamics, with profound neurodevelopmental deficits. We have also
developed a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based model from patients with
TUBB4A
D249N
mutation to generate iPSC derived medium striatal neurons (MSN). MSNs were
successfully derived from control and TUBB4A
D249N
patient iPSCs, however early studies indicate decreased neuronal survival and
increased apoptosis in TUBB4A
D249N
 patient derived neurons. Ongoing studies are focused on modeling the spectrum of
TUBB4A associated mutations and understanding the cellular mechanisms and affected pathways
in H-ABC. These studies will be important from basic science and pre-clinical perspective
with human iPSC serving as a platform for future drug screening..

Entry of pathogenic T cells into the central nervous system (CNS) causes disease in the
multiple sclerosis (MS) animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
Extravasation across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) occurs via transcellular trafficking
within endocytic vesicles such as caveolae, or between endothelial cells by tight junction
dissolution. However, signals targeting infiltrating cells to transcellular instead of
paracellular migration remain unclear. Our data suggest that endothelial cell Caveolin-1
engage chemokine receptor positive T cells in luminal-to-abluminal trafficking into the CNS.
Our findings suggest that chemo-kine-enhanced Caveolin-1 signaling may be a target for
modulating BBB permeability..

Intracranial inoculation of the neuroadapted JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV)
into susceptible strains of mice results in an acute encephalomyelitis and chronic
immune-mediated demyelination. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated an
important role for neutrophils in contributing to demyelination in JHMV-infected mice.
However, potential mechanisms by which neutrophils augment white matter damage have not been
well characterized. Using JHMV infection of transgenic mice, in which expression of the
neutrophil chemoattractant chemokine CXCL1 is under the control of a tetracycline-inducible
promoter active within GFAP-positive cells, results in sustained CXCL1 expression within the
CNS that correlates with increased neutrophil numbers in both the brain and spinal cord
throughout disease. We used flow cyto-metry and protein analysis to characterize neutrophils
that migrate to the CNS both morphologically and phenotypically before damage to CNS occurs.
In addition, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on CD45+ cells isolated from
the spinal cords of JHMV-infected transgenic mice to examine how sustained neutrophil
recruitment into the CNS affects the immunological landscape during the damage phase of
disease. Neutrophils that migrate to the CNS following JHMV infection have a distinct
morphology that correlates with increased proinflammatory neutrophil associated protein
levels. This study highlights the role of neutrophils in responding to murine coronavirus
infection of the CNS and their sensitivity to the micro-environment which can induce
morphologic and gene expression profile changes that correlate with an increase in the
severity of demyelination..

BLOCKADE OF CXCR2 PROMOTES THE RECRUITMENT OF A REPARATIVE MYELOID SUBSET TO THE
INFLAMED CNS
.

Studies in animal models have shown that, in certain settings, alternative types of
inflammation can exert protective and/ or regenerative effects. These beneficial immune
responses often involve myeloid cells that produce trophic factors and anti-, as opposed to
pro-, inflammatory molecules. A mouse model that has been used to study inflammation-driven
repair in the central nervous system (CNS) involves the administration of zymosan, a yeast
cell wall extract, by intraocular ( i.o.) injection at the time of, our shortly following,
retro-orbital optic nerve crush (ONC) injury. Normally, retinal ganglion cells (RGC, the
neurons that give rise to the optic nerve) do not extend lengthy axons beyond a crush injury
site; however, robust axonal growth occurs after induction of “sterile” vitreal inflammation
via i.o. injection of zymosan. Although monocytes/ macrophages have most commonly been
implicated in reparative immune responses in the dermis and other extra-CNS tissues, we
found that neutrophils predominated zymosan-induced vitreal infiltrates. Treatment of mice
with an anti-CXCR2 antisera following ONC and i.o. zymosan injection, in order prevent
neutrophil migration to the eye, unexpectedly enhanced RGC axonal regeneration. Further
analyses revealed that anti-CXCR2 impeded the infiltration of mature neutrophils into the
posterior chamber of the eye, allowing the entry of a novel myeloid subset. Here, we
characterize the phenotype of this pro-regenerative cell type and examine its mechanism of
action..

CD4+ T helper (Th) cells play a central role in orchestrating protective
immunity but also in driving the development of autoimmunity. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a
human autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by the
infiltration of inflammatory lymphocytes and myeloid cells into the brain and spinal cord,
leading to demyelination, axonal damage, and progressive loss of motor functions. The
release of T cells in the circulation and their migration in the central nervous system are
tightly regulated processes. Integrin alpha 4 and Sphingosine-1 phos-phate receptor 1
(S1P1) neutralization are being used as disease modifying therapies in MS.
Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models, we have studied how the
modulation of these pathways regulate the trafficking of T cells. Specifically, we will
discuss how Itga4 and S1P1 modulation can selectively regulate the entry of Th1, Th17 and
regulatory T cells in the CNS and the development of EAE..

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of
COVID-19, a coronavirus disease that, as of April 14, 2021, has infected more than 137
million people and caused over 2.9 million deaths worldwide and paralyzed global economies.
The pandemic continues unabated and certain aspects of the disease continue to baffle
clinicians and researchers. Although over 150 vaccine candidates are in the preclinical or
the exploratory stage of development, there is still much to learn from SARS-CoV-2. A
remarkable finding, from our laboratory, was that the SARS-CoV- 2 Spike protein can reverse
allodynia in a rodent model of neuro-pathic pain. We identifed and characterize a novel role
of neuropilin receptor 1 (NRP-1), upstream of the cytosolic regulator collapsin response
mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), in nociceptive processing. In this talk, I discuss: (1) the
molecular gateways used by the virus to enter the nervous system, particularly the
nociceptors; (2) the potentially analgesic effect of the SARS-CoV-2's spike protein results
in a reduced pain response during infections, thus making this virus even more insidious;
(3) testimonials from chronic pain patients who report transient pain loss during COVID-19.
Prior to the ‘surprise’ emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in December of 2019, the United
States and parts of the World were mired by the opioid epidemic. Thus, the findings
presented in this symposium are relevant to two current global health crises as emerging
data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to compound the opioid epidemic..

TARGETING THE CRMP2-CLN6 COMPLEX IN BATTEN DISEASE
.

Jill Weimer.


Sanford Research, Pediatrics and Rare Diseases Group, Sioux Falls, USA
.

Neurons are dependent upon the transport of cargo along micro-tubule networks and delivery
of this cargo is necessary to support neuronal development, differentiation, maintenance,
and health. A novel protein complex, composed of CLN6: an ER-associated protein of unknown
function implicated in Batten disease, CRMP2: a tubulin binding protein important in
regulating neurite microtubule dynamics and transport, and KLC4: a classic microtubule
binding motor protein, is required for vesicular transport in neurons. Loss of CLN6 alters
CRMP2 interactions with other protein partners, disrupts ER-vesicle trafficking, and leads
to reduced neurite outgrowth and complexity. Treatment with a CRMP2 modulating compound,
lanthionine ketamine ester, partially restored these deficits in a mouse model of CLN6
deficiency, indicating that stabilization of CRMP2 interacting partners may prove beneficial
in lieu of restoring the CCK complex. Taken together, these findings boast a novel mechanism
of ER vesicle transport in the axon, and provide new insights into thera-peutic targets for
neurodegenerative disease..

Deletion of the ngr1 allele limits the severity of experimental
auto-immune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by preserving axonal integrity. However, whether this
favorable outcome observed in EAE is a consequence of an abrogated neuronal-specific
pathophysiological mechanism, is yet to be defined. Here we show that, Cre-loxP-mediated
neuron-specific deletion of ngr1 preserved axonal integrity, whereas its
re-expression in ngr1
−/-
 female mice potentiated EAE-axonopathy. As a corollary, myelin integrity was
preserved under Credeletion in ngr1
flx/flx
, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons whereas, significant demyelination occurred in the
ngr1
−/-
optic nerves following the re-introduction of NgR1. Moreover,
Cre-loxP-mediated axon-specific deletion of ngr1 in ngr1
flx/flx
 mice also demonstrated efficient anterograde transport of fluorescently-labeled ChTxB
in the optic nerves of EAE-induced mice. However, the anterograde transport of ChTxB
displayed accumulation in optic nerve degenerative axons of EAE-induced
ngr1
−/-
 mice, when NgR1 was re-introduced but was shown to be transported
efficiently in the contralateral non-rAAV2- transduced optic nerves of these mutant mice. We
further identified that the interaction between the axonal motor protein, kinesin-1 and
collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) was unchanged upon Cre deletion of
ngr1. Whereas, this Kinesin-1/CRMP2 association was reduced when
NgR1 was re-expressed in the ngr1
−/-
 optic nerves. We then utilized transplantable HSCs as a cellular delivery method of
the NgR(310)ecto-Fc fusion protein a therapeutic fusion protein that has been successfully
applied as a treatment in animal models of spinal cord injury and glaucoma. Animals
transplanted with LV-NgR(310)ecto-Fc-overexpressing HSCs, recovered from the peak of
neurological symptoms associated with EAE, exhibiting axonal regeneration and eventual
remyelination in the white matter tracts. Our data suggest that NgR1 governs axonal
degeneration in the context of inflammatory-mediated demyelination through the
phos-phorylation of CRMP2 by stalling axonal vesicular transport. Moreover, axon-specific
deletion of ngr1 preserves axonal transport mechanisms, blunting the
induction of inflammatory demyelination. We suggest that HSCs can be utilized as carriers of
the therapeutic NgR-Fc protein for specific delivery into EAE lesions and can potentiate
neurological recovery by limiting NgR1-dependent signaling, thereby enhancing
neurorepair..

APOE is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's
disease. ApoE exacerbates tau-associated neurodegeneration by driving microglial activation.
However, how apoE regulates micro-glial activation and whether targeting apoE is
therapeutically beneficial in tauopathy is unclear. Here we show that overexpressing an apoE
metabolic receptor LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) in P301S tauopathy mice markedly
reduces brain apoE, and ameliorates tau pathology and neurodegeneration. LDLR
overex-pression in microglia cell-autonomously downregulates microglial
Apoe expression, and is associated with suppressed microglial activation
as is in apoE-deficient microglia. Both apoE-deficiency and LDLR-overexpression strongly
drive microglial immunometa-bolism towards enhanced catabolism over anabolism, whereas
LDLR-overexpressing microglia also uniquely upregulate specific ion channels and
neurotransmitter receptors upon activation. ApoE-deficient and LDLR-overexpressing mice
harbor enlarged pools of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and show greater
preservation of myelin integrity under neurodegenerative conditions. They also show less
“disease-associated astrocyte” activation in the setting of tauopathy..

AQP4 STOP CODON READTHROUGH FACILITATES AMYLOID-Β CLEARANCE FROM THE BRAIN
.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is initiated by the toxic aggregation of Amyloid beta (Aβ).
Immunotherapeutics aimed at reducing Aβ are in clinical trials but with very limited success
to date. Identification of orthogonal approaches for clearing Aβ may complement these
approaches for treating AD. In the brain, the astrocytic water channel Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is
involved in clearance of Aβ, and the fraction of AQP4 found perivascularly is decreased in
AD. Further, an unusual stop codon readthrough event generates a conserved C-terminally
elongated variant of AQP4 (AQP4X), which is exclusively perivascular. However, it is unclear
if the AQP4X variant specifically mediates Aβ clearance. Here, using AQP4
readthrough-specific knockout mice that still express normal AQP4, we determine this isoform
indeed mediates Aβ clearance. Further, with high-throughput screening and counterscreening,
we identify small molecule compounds that enhance readthrough of the AQP4 sequence, and
validate a subset on endogenous astrocyte AQP4. Finally, we demonstrate these compounds
enhance brain Aβ clearance in vivo, which depends on AQP4X. This suggests
derivatives of these compounds may provide a viable pharmaceutical approach to enhance
clearance of Aβ and potentially other aggregating proteins in neuro-degenerative
disease..

Multiple different neurological disorders, like neurodegenerative disorders or neural
insults such as stroke create a neuroinflammatory response that leads to glial cell
activation. These cells change their conformation and take on multiple different phenotypes,
causing them to lose much of their normal functions and take on an inflammatory role.
Activation of microglia following injury leads to the conversion of astrocytes into an “A1”
phenotype that is more neuro-toxic in (Parkinson's Disease and optic nerve crush models).
Three cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1a (Il-1a), and complement
component 1q (C1q) are released from microglia and have been determined to induce the A1
astrocyte phenotype. We prevented “A1” neurotoxic astrocyte formation after stroke with
triple knockout (TNF-, Il-1a-, and C1q-) mice, and compared their neuroin-flammatory
response and stroke size to wildtype mice. We hypothesized that inhibition of “A1”
astrocytes in triple knockout mice would lead to less astrogliosis and reduced infarct size.
Following distal middle cerebral artery occlusion, the infarct size of triple knockout mice
was significantly less than wildtype mice at both 1 (p<0.05) and 7 days
(p<0.0001) post-ischemia. We also found a reduction in astrogliosis in
the triple knockout animals 7 days post-stroke (p<0.05). No significant
reduction of infarct size (p=0.4343) was found 28 days post-dMCAO, but
there was a reduction in astrogliosis (p<0.05) in the triple knockout
animals. Removing “A1” neurotoxic astrocytes from the neuroinflammatory response to stroke
led to a reduction in the glial response to stroke and reduced infarct volume. Understanding
the neurotoxic phenotype of this astrocyte activation and its feedback role on other
resident and infiltrating cells could lead to treatments to reduce an exacerbated
neuroinflammatory response..

Recombinant human IgM22(rHIgM22) binds to myelin and oligo-dendrocytes(OLs) and promotes
remyelination in mouse models of multiple sclerosis(MS). However, the target antigen and the
signaling mechanisms through which rHIgM22 exerts its function are still unclear..

In vitro analysis revealed that rIHgM22 binds to sulfatide, but also to
phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid. Moreover, the composition of
the lipid microenvironment of its antigen can modulate the affinity of the antibody,
suggesting that reorganization of lipid membrane might be relevant in its biological
activity..

In rat mixed glial cells(MGC), rHIgM22 causes an increase in the levels of PDGFαR and
induces a dose-dependent proliferative response in all the cells in the culture, with the
most significant response associated with astrocytes. Moreover, rHIgM22 increases the
production and release of sphingosine 1-phosphate(S1P) in MGC while total levels of ceramide
remain unchanged. Furthermore, release of S1P is strongly reduced by a selective inhibitor
of PDGFαR. Increased S1P production is not mediated by regulation of sphingosine kinase 1
and 2, instead, we observe a significant reduction of S1P lyase. Remarkably, rHIgM22
treatment does not induce changes in the production and/or release of S1P in astrocytes, but
it increases its release in BV2 cells, suggesting that rHIgM22 indirectly influences the
proliferation of astrocytes in MGCs, by affecting ceramide/S1P balance..

Analysis of the effect of rHIgM22 on glycosphingolipid metabolism in MGC and astrocytes
revealed no significant effects on the lipid pattern, while in OPCs and OLs we observe an
increase in the levels of different gangliosides, known for their ability to interact with
and modulate the activity of different growth factor receptors..

Considering all this, we propose that rHIgM22 protective effects might be mediated by
alterations of lipid-dependent membrane organization and/or signalling in different cell
types present in the nice of MS lesions and that a complex cross talk between different cell
types is underlying the ultimate repair effect elicited by this antibody..

The extent to which NG2+cells contribute to glial and fibrotic scar formation
after spinal cord injury (SCI) is poorly understood. To selectively ablate dividing
NG2+ cells responding to SCI, we utilized a novel transgenic mouse line in
which cells expressing NG2 also express a thymidine kinase from herpes simplex virus (NG2-tk
mice). Intraventricular administration of antiviral agent ganciclovier (GCV) causes
apoptosis in dividing NG2+cells (including oligodendrocyte progenitors and
pericytes). Immediately following unilateral white matter-specific C5 SCI in NG2-tk mice, a
drug delivery pump was placed subcutaneously with attached catheter inserted into the
ventricle to administer GCV or saline for 14 days. Our prior work showed ablation of
NG2+ cells significantly altered density and distribution of glial and fibrotic
scars through 21d post-injury. Compared to controls, these alterations prolonged hemorrhage,
enhanced edema, and impaired forelimb recovery, but also increased axons entering the lesion
area (Hesp et al., 2018). The present study assessed long-term consequences of acute
NG2+cell ablation. Drug pumps were removed after 14 days, allowing a recovery
period before assessment at sixor eight-weeks post-SCI. In contrast to earlier time points,
overall density of GFAP in the glial scar and laminin within the fibrotic scar did not
significantly differ between NG2+ cell-ablated and non-ablated mice. However,
there were differences in scar density and patterning, suggesting altered recovery after GCV
cessation. A unique pattern emerged in the gray matter adjacent to the lesion, with
significantly increased laminin profiles resembling blood vessels in NG2+
cell-ablated mice at both time points. Consistent with acute findings, more axonal profiles
were maintained within lesions in GCV-treated mice. Iimpaired motor recovery also persisted
through 8w post-injury. Clarifying the roles of NG2+ oligodendrocyte progenitors versus
pericytes will be important to further define the contributions of each cell type to
beneficial and deleterious cellular responses to CNS injury..

Astrocytes comprise a highly complex cell population with diverse structural and functional
properties in both the healthy and diseased central nervous system. Astrocytic pathology has
been implicated in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, however, their structural
rearrangement in brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain poorly understood.
Here, we applied super-resolution imaging and 3-dimensional (3D) electron microscopy
approaches to better understand the structural changes of astrocytes in AD model (hAPP/ PS1)
mice. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) of genetically-labeled astrocytes allowed us
to capture global modifications to individual astrocyte shape while resolving certain
aspects of their subcellular organelle distribution. We observed perturbations to the
complex branching pattern of whole astrocytes and additionally, mapped the organization of
mitochondria throughout the cell in AD model samples. Results from SIM imaging were
complemented with analysis using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM)
that enabled 3D serial reconstruction of astrocyte ultrastructure. Using FIB-SEM, we found
dramatic restructuring of astrocyte subcompartments in neuropil and astrocytic endfeet,
including major alterations of astrocytic process shape and the restructuring/redistribution
of mitochondria. Quantitative analysis of SIM and FIB-SEM approaches allowed us to directly
compare the astrocytic surface structure and the organelle distribution/ morphology within
astrocyte sub-compartments using custom MATLAB scripts, in healthy and AD model tissue. This
multi-level structural analysis of astrocytes provides an important understanding of how
astrocytes are constructed in the healthy brain and altered with brain disease..

Increasing evidence suggests that the inciting pathogenic events in Alzheimer's disease may
involve disruption of the multicellular interactions within the neurovascular unit. The
interruption of specific molecular pathways within the neurovascular unit occurs antecedent
to classic pathology and therefore is an attractive target to modulate neurodegeneration.
However, the majority of molecular pathways regulating neural and gliovascular signaling
remain unknown.Single-cell and whole tissue gene expression approaches have been used in
various animal models of dementia to discern new pathways but are limited by sequencing
depth and spatiotemporal accuracy of transcriptional profiling. We developed an approach for
identifying relevant and novel pathways within the multicellular environment of the
neurovascular unit interactions in Alzheimer's disease. Cell-specific viral constructs
coding for antigen-tagged ribosomes (TRAP) were used to study variance in spatial and
temporal gene expression patterns within and between cell types in the PS19 (P301S)
transgenic model of tauopathy. The engineered lentiviruses and adeno-associated viruses
express an HA-tagged ribosomal protein (Rpl10a-HA) driven by a cell-type specific promoter
(Synapsin, GFAP, or PDGFRa) for the major cell types of the neurovascular unit. We
demonstrated the ability of the viruses to target specific cell types under particular
spatiotemporal conditions and confirmed cell-specificity in vivo using both
known cell-specific markers and novel markers identified by sequencing. We then combined
this cell-specific vTRAP system with the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy to generate multiple
cell-type specific transcriptomic databases of the neurovascular unit across several
pathologically-relevant time points. Gene ontology analysis indicates a prodromal drive by
gliovascular cells including pericytes and astrocytes to support injured neurons. This
occurs through specific and temporally regulated coordination of multiple molecular programs
driving neuronal differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and synaptogenesis. This suggests a
paradigm for gliovascular rescue of neurodegeneration phenomena and implicates numerous
novel perivascular molecular pathways in the pathogenesis of tauopathy and Alzheimer's
disease..

Astrocytes provide diverse support for brain function by maintaining essential interactions
with endothelial cells to form the BBB. Pathological astrocyte-BBB interactions contribute
to ischemic stroke, which is the 5th leading cause of death in the US. However,
the mechanisms underlying maintenance of BBB integrity both in health and diseases such as
stroke remain poorly defined. our study focuses on an astrocyte-enriched sodium-bicarbonate
cotransporter, Slc4a4, which was previously identified as an astrocyte-specific regulator of
both intracellular and extracellular pH. While pH homeostasis is essential for metabolic
activity in the brain, the role of Slc4a4 in astrocyte-BBB integrity remains unknown. To
address the role of Slc4a4 in this context, we generated new transgenic mouse lines that
temporally ablate Slc4a4 in astrocytes. Using this genetic mouse model, we show loss of
Slc4a4 in adult significantly dampens astrocyte endfeet Ca2+ signaling and
generates enlarged blood vessels with disrupted endothelial junctions. Combination of
transcriptome, proteomic and metabolomic profiling of Slc4a4-ablated astrocytes and
conditioned media (CM) of Slc4a4- ablated astrocytes reveal dysregulation of genes
associated with vasculature-BBB maintenance, inflammatory chemo-cytokines, and glial
metabolism, further supporting a crucial role for Slc4a4 in BBB integrity by governing
astrocyte-endothelia cell crosstalk. Among differentially expressed genes associated with
Slc4a4 deletion, we confirm the upregulation of Ccl2 (C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2) in the
CM of Slc4a4-ablated astrocytes and Slc4a4-deficient brain. We further validate the
Slc4a4-Ccl2 axis using in vitro BBB model and find that blocking Ccl2
pathway restores endothelial junction and permeability. Using a mouse model of stroke, we
found loss of Slc4a4 exacerbates stroke-induced motor dysfunction, mortality and BBB
disruption coupled with impaired reactive gliosis. Together, our study indicates the
indispensable role of Slc4a4 mediated astrocyte-BBB interaction, providing insights for the
potential of glia meta-bolism regulators as novel therapeutic approach for BBB-related CNS
disorders..

Linoleic acid derived lipoxygenase hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid metabolites (9-HODE and
13-HODE) have anti-inflammatory properties but their clinical associations with Alzheimer's
disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) have not been established. We
aim to examine these metabolites with respect to microstructural white matter integrity and
vascular brain lesion characteristics. Patients from memory and stroke prevention clinics
(n=69) were stratified based on SIVD (minimal vs. abundant white matter hyperintensities
[WMH] based on 3.0T structural MRI), and AD (clinical diagnosis). 9-HODE and 13-HODE were
extracted from serum using solid phase extraction and concentrations measured by ultra
high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Microstructural brain tissue
integrity was examined as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) using
diffusion tensor imaging. Using multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for age and
sex, 13-HODE was lower in people with AD (F1,68=6.52, p=0.013, n=23) but not with
SIVD (F1,68=0.14, p=0.7, n=38). 13-HODE was associated with higher FA in normal
appearing white matter (β=0.303, p=0.017), negatively associated with periventricular WMH-FA
(β=-0.381, p=0.048), and positively associated with with periventricular WMH-MD (β=0.257,
p=0.048). In patients without AD, 9-HODE and 13-HODE were negatively associated with WMH
volume (β=-0.322, p=0.018 and β=-0.324, p=0.019). Additionally, 9- HODE was positively
associated with FA in normal appearing white matter (β=0.341, p=0.041) and periventricular
WMH-MD (β=0.381, p=0.025). Anti-inflammatory linoleic acid oxylipins were associated with
preserved white matter integrity, smaller vascular brain lesion volumes, and vascular brain
lesion microstructural characteristics. AD was associated with a relative deficit in these
mediators..

Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and dysregulated immune signaling. ER stress occurs when the protein folding
capacity of the ER is overwhelmed, resulting in initiation of the unfolded protein response
(UPR) to restore homeostasis. Unresolved UPR activation leads to cell death and
inflammation. We have described an ER-stress induced Janus Kinase (JAK) 1 - Signal
Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) 3-dependent mechanism that promotes
expression of inflammatory mediators including Interleukin-6 (IL-6). JAK1 is initiated by
cytokine stimulation to promote inflammatory gene expression, and additionally, using
RNA-seq, we have shown JAK1 controls many ER stress-induced genes. We found that less than
10% of the ER stress-induced JAK1-dependent genes are also induced by cytokine stimulation,
demonstrating ER stress and cyto-kine stimulation induce distinct JAK1-dependent
transcriptional profiles in astrocytes, a nonneuronal brain cell that responds to insult by
producing soluble immune mediators. We found that JAK1 controls expression of genes that are
not regulated by STATs, but by activating transcription factor (ATF) 4. We have shown that
JAK1 and ATF4 physically interact and, via chromatin immunopre-cipitation (ChIP), in
response to ER stress, ATF4 is effectively recruited to these promoters of these genes in a
JAK1-dependent manner suggesting that JAK1 is involved in directing ATF4-dependent gene
expression in a gene specific manner. These findings suggest JAK1 is a major driver of
transcription in response to cellular stress, and JAK1 exhibits novel signaling mechanisms
to regulate gene expression through ATF4..

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating condition that affects around 5.8 million of
Americans, and these numbers are projected to reach nearly 14 million individuals around
2050. Although AD was first described more than 100 years ago, until nowadays that are not
effective treatments to counteract or efficiently slow down the progression of the disease.
This is likely, due at least in part, to the fact that AD animal models have been focused in
the use of transgenic rodent models, failing to translate the findings to humans with the
disease. We describe here a non-human primate model of AD presenting extensive tau
pathology, mainly affecting the hippocampus and connected areas. Adult rhesus monkeys
injected with adeno-associated viruses expressing mutant tau (P301L/S320F) in the left
entorhinal cortex (ERC) show after 3 months, extensive prion-like tau propagation with full
fibrillary tangles in the hippocampus, as well as pre-tangles and phospho-tau in projection
areas such as the contralateral ERC and in the retrosplenial and visual cortices.
Importantly, neuroinflammation is extensive in the affected areas, with a major role of
microglia in pathological tau oligomer pro-pagation. Finally, the mutant h4R injected
coaptates monkey 3R tau generating more tau aggregation and spreading. These results
highlight the first stages of tau pathology and propagation and support the importance of a
non-human model of AD, with natural full expression of tau protein, that is highly
translational to humans..

Astrocytes are positioned between neurons and blood vessels with fine processes that oppose
synapses and endfeet that enwrap the vasculature. This localization allows astrocytes to
participate in several aspects of brain homeostasis, including glutamate clearance, but it
also permits neurons and endothelia to influence astrocyte biology. Astrocytes express two
subtypes of glutamate transporters. The expression of one of these transporters, GLT1/EAAT2,
increases dramatically during synaptogenesis, providing a surrogate marker of astrocyte
maturation. We and others have demonstrated that astro-cytes cultured alone express little
or no GLT1 and that co-culturing with neurons or endothelia induces expression of GLT1 in
astrocytes. While several signaling pathways have been implicated in neuron-dependent
induction, we previously showed that Notch is required for the effect of endothelia. Our
research has two goals: 1) determine which components of Notch signaling mediate the effect
of endo-thelia, and 2) determine how neurons and endothelia synergistically affect the
transcriptome of astrocytes. To address the first goal, we cultured
cortical astrocytes in the presence or absence of the mouse endothelioma cell line bEND.3.
Using recombinant Notch ligands, neutralizing antibodies, and shRNAs directed against Notch
ligands in bEND.3 cells, we found that both delta-like Notch ligands, DLL1 and DLL4, are
involved in endothelial-dependent induction of GLT1. Our studies also showed that astrocytes
increase expression of DLL4 in endothelia. This now published study showed that reciprocal
communication between astrocytes and endothelia contributed to the maturation of both cells
(Martinez-Lozada & Robinson Neurochem Int 2020). To address the
second goal, we cultured cortical astrocytes alone or in the
presence of bEND.3 or rat cortical neurons, or both. We isolated astrocytes using
fluorescence-activated cell sorting and performed RNA-seq and bioinformatic analysis. We
found that neurons and endothelia have both complementary/additive and competitive effects
on the astrocyte transcriptome. Overall, our study indicates that astrocytes receive an
intricate combination of signals from neurons and endothelial cells which ultimately dictate
astrocyte biology..

Demyelination occurs in a large variety of central nervous system (CNS) insults,
pathologies, and neurodegenerative diseases, including Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Parenchymal
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) located throughout the CNS participate in endogenous
remyelination of white matter lesions, migrating to the injury site and maturing into
myelinating oligodendrocytes, albeit at low levels. An additional source of OPCs following
CNS injury is neural stem cell (NSC)-derived OPCs generated in the subventricular zone (SVZ)
of the lateral ventricles. Therefore, promoting increased levels of NSC gliogenesis is a
promising therapeutic strategy for demyelinating disorders like MS. We previously identified
the Endothelin-1 (ET-1) signaling pathway as a novel regulator of NSC and OPC proliferation
during early postnatal development (Adams et al. 2020). Therefore, we asked whether ET-1
also regulates stem and progenitor cells in the adult SVZ, both during homeostasis and after
demyelinating injury. We found that the majority of NSC populations in the adult mouse SVZ
express the ET-1 receptor, Ednrb. Ablation of Ednrb from NSCs reduced both the number of
activated and quiescent NSCs, indicating that ET-1 signaling is required for maintenance of
NSCs in the adult mouse. Following focal demyelination of the corpus callosum, SVZ NSCs
upregulated expression of ET-1. Ablation of ET-1 reduced the percentages of proliferating
NSCs and proliferating OPCs in the SVZ, suggesting that ET-1 plays a critical role in the
SVZ proliferative response to injury. RNAseq of cultured primary NSCs and OPCs treated with
ET-1 identified genes involved in stem cell maintenance, including Notch signaling, and OPC
migration. Lastly, we confirmed that ET-1 and EDNRB expression are conserved in the adult
human SVZ, indicating that this pathway may be a potential target for promoting SVZ-mediated
cellular repair..

Neuronal circuit development is a complex process consisting of precise steps in the
directional growth and maturation of axons and dendrites to synapse formation and
elimination. The development of axons and dendrites, in particular, is largely dependent on
extra-cellular guidance cues. The large family of Semaphorin molecular cues is known to
regulate axon guidance, dendrite elaboration and synapse elimination in the developing
mammalian nervous system. In particular, the class 3 secreted Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A),
through its receptor complex Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1)/PlexinA4 (PlxnA4), has been shown to induce
dendritic elaboration in cortical neurons in vitro and in
vivo. Previously, we showed that the KRK amino acid motif in the PlxnA4 receptor
is required for cortical dendritic elaboration through the interaction with the RhoGEF FARP2
and activation of Rac1. However, it is not known whether other signaling motifs in the
PlxnA4 receptor could also mediate dendrite development. Here, we show that the LVS motif,
located in the Rho GTPase binding domain of PlxnA4, is required for Sema3A-mediated
den-dritic elaboration in cortical neurons. Moreover, our findings show for the first time
that gene transcription and protein translation are required in Sema3A-induced dendritic
elaboration of cortical neurons in vitro during the initial stages of
dendritic elaboration, but not later stages. Next, we will identify novel downstream gene
targets of Sema3A-induced dendrite elaboration by using RNA sequencing in our established
primary cortical neuron system and in vivo using specific genetically
modified mouse lines. Taken together, our study provides novel insights to the intracellular
mechanisms underlying Sema3A-mediated dendritic morphogenesis in cortical neuron
development, and dissects the multifunctional roles of the PlxnA4 receptor in the proper
formation of neuronal connections..

TGFBETA1 DEPENDENT GPNMB EXPRESSION IN NEURAL STEM CELLS INHIBITS
OLIGODENDROGENESIS
.

University of Wisconsin-Madison, Comparative Biosciences, Madison, USA

Demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) is a pathological feature of many
neurodegenerative diseases, and leads to altered signaling, axonal stress, and
neurodegeneration. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) presents with widespread demyelination, which is
refractory to current treatments and interventions. Recent research identified a population
of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) that express the transcription factor Gli1 in the adult
subventricular zone (SVZ) and are capable of generating new oligodendrocytes for
remye-linating the CNS. Loss of Gli1 in these NSCs further increases their recruitment to
the site of demyelination and differentiation into mye-linating oligodendrocytes, with
functional improvement in an Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. To
understand the molecular underpinnings of enhanced remyelina-tion, we performed an RNAseq
screen in NSCs with loss of Gli1 from demyelinated brain and identified Glycoprotein
non-metastatic melanoma b (Gpnmb) as the most differentially expressed gene with ∼6 fold
higher expression in wildtype NSCs. In the healthy brain, Gpnmb is expressed in subsets of
NSCs, microglia, astrocytes, oligo-dendrocyte precursors (OPCs), and neurons but not mature
oligodendrocytes. Global knockout of Gpnmb results in an increase in mature oligodendrocyte
generation during remyelination, while over-expression of Gpnmb in vitro
suppresses oligodendrocyte gene expression; thus indicating that Gpnmb inhibits
remyelination. We also found that TGFß1 secreted from the site of demyelination increases
Gpnmb expression in NSCs. In addition, increased Gpnmb levels stimulate TGFß-R2 expression,
the ligand binding subunit of the TGFß1 receptor dimer, indicating Gpnmb may function in a
feed-forward loop to sensitize NSCs to TGFß1. Taken together, our data strongly implicate
Gpnmb as a negative regulator of remyelination that is regulated by and feeds forward to
amplify TGFß1 signaling..

In the visual system, retinal axons convey visual information from the outside world to
dozens of distinct retinorecipient brain regions. In rodents, two major areas that are
densely innervated by this retinal input are the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN)
and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), both of which reside in the thalamus. The
dLGN is well-studied and known to be important for classical image-forming vision. The vLGN,
on the other hand, is associated with non-image-forming vision and its neurochemistry,
cytoarchitecture, and retinothalamic connectivity all remain unresolved, raising fundamental
questions of its role within the visual system. Here, we sought to shed light on these
important questions by studying the cellular landscape of the vLGN and map its connectivity
with the retina. Using in situ hybridization, immuno-histochemistry,
electrophysiology, and genetic reporter lines, we discovered at least six transcriptionally
distinct subtypes of inhibitory neurons that are distributed into distinct adjacent
sublaminae. Using trans-synaptic viral tracing and in vitro electrophysiology, we found that
cells in each these sublaminae receive direct inputs from retina. Lastly, by genetically
removing this visual input to the vLGN, we found that the organization of these sublaminae
is dramatically disrupted, suggesting a crucial role for sensory input in the
cyto-architectural maintenance of the vLGN. Taken together, these results not only identify
novel subtypes of vLGN cells, but they also point to new means of organizing visual
information into parallel pathways – by anatomically creating distinct sensory channels.
This subtype-specific organization may be key to understanding how the vLGN receives,
processes, and transmits light-derived signals in the subcortical visual system..

preference of these cells to the polycation polyethyleneimine (Sepulveda-Díaz et aI, Glia,
2016; dos-Santos Pereira et aI, Glia, 2018). We established that CBD (1-10 µM) was highly
efficient in reducing inflammatory-type responses triggered by the Toll-inflam-matory
cytokines TNF-a and IL-1ß and that of glutamate,a noncyto-kine mediator of inflammation.
Interestingly, CBD was also highly effective against other inflammatory signaling
molecules,theTLR-2 agonist Pam3CSK-4 and the P2X7 agonist BzATP, indicating that CBD
inhibitory effects were not restricted to a particular inflammatory pathway.The effects of
CBD were predominantly receptor independent; they were only marginally blunted by SCH336, a
selective antagonist/inverse agonist at CB2 receptors and insensitive to antagonists of CB1
receptors and PPAR-y. Additional experiments revealed that CBD had the capacity to restrain
LPS-Induced Inflammatory events by interfering with a signaling cascade involving the ROS
producing enzyme NADPH oxidase and subsequently NF-xB dependent signaling. Importantly, we
noticed that NF-KB inhibition by either CBD (1,10 µM) or TPCA-1, an IKB kinase inhibitor
counteracted the rise in glucose uptake that is observed after exposure of microglial cells
to LPS, suggesting that CBD occluded pro inflammatory events by lowering glucose
consumption. Comforting this view, CBD anti-inflammatory effects were mimicked by
2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a synthetic non-metabollzable glucose analog. CBD and 2-DG led to
a reduction of glucose-derived NADPH, a requisite factor for ROS production by NADPH
oxidase. Altogether, our findings suggest that CBD possesses potent anti-inflammatory
effects towards microglial cells through an antioxidant mechanism that restrains glucose
utilization and NADPH synthesis.Present data also further confirm that CBD may have a
therapeutic interest in conditions where neuro-inflammatory processes are prominent..

N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated calcium channels, which play a
major role in synaptic plasticity..

Dysregulation of NMDAR is associated with several neuro-degenerative and neuropsychiatric
disorders. The NMDAR subunits GluN2A/ Grin2A and GluN2B/
Grin2B have a developmentally regulated expression profile (Cathala L et
al., 2002, J.Neurosci.,20. p5899). We found that Grin2B expression is
highest in days in vitro 7-9 (DIV 7-9) in rat hippocampal primary neuronal
cultures and declines thereafter. Grin2A expression becomes significant by
DIV 7-9 and the level is maintained subsequently..

Drugs that target NMDAR have major side effects and hence alternate subtle strategies are
needed to indirectly target these receptors. The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in neurological
disorders is being widely explored (Wang W. et al, 2012, Learn. Mem.,19. p359). Our
objective is to understand the mechanism of action of some miRNAs involved in NMDAR-mediated
synaptic plasticity that are also differentially expressed in disease conditions. Some
miRNAs that are altered in schizophrenia, Huntington disease and autism were predicted to
interact with NMDAR subunits. Luciferase assays showed that miRNAs such as miR-223 and
miR-129 interacted with the subunits of NMDAR. Expression levels of the target proteins in
primary hippocampal neurons was downregulated after transfection of miRNA. To study
regulation by these miRNAs in vivo we have established the MK-801 model and
the MAM model of Schizophrenia. We have injected rats with MK-801 at post natal days 30-40
for five days followed by five day washout period. We injected MAM at gestational day 17 and
the pups were weaned at P30. The animals underwent different behavior tests such as open
field test, object recognition test and Morris water maze test. It was found that the
treated animals have major cognitive impairment. Expression of some of the miRNA/s and their
target proteins in these animals is under investigation. These studies may unravel novel
mechanisms, which can be of therapeutic potential..

Ketogenic diet (KD; high-fat, low-carbohydrate) has emerged as a lifestyle change that may
promote stress resilience. This study investigates the possible resilience-promoting
properties of KD and aims to unravel underlying mechanisms by focusing on microglia
specifically, the resident immune cells of the brain. Using 2 month-old adult male C57BL/6
mice, we studied the effects of KD versus normal diet (ND) exposure for 4
weeks. The consequences of chronic stress under KD versus ND were
investigated by comparing non-stressed controls with animals undergoing 10 days of repeated
social defeat (RSD). After RSD, mice underwent a social interaction test (SIT) to classify
them as resilient or susceptible to stress. We are focusing on the ventral hippocampus CA1
stratum radiatum, previously shown to be affected by chronic stress. Our
results show that after RSD, ketogenic diet increased the proportion of resilient animals,
57.14% of KD mice (n=28) vs 36.36% of ND (n=22). We studied the effect that
ketogenic diet on its own might have on microglia. Using TMEM119/IBA1 double staining we
have observed that KD does not affect microglia number and distribution. Nevertheless, the
microglia of KD animals show increased soma and arborization area. This observation is very
important given that changes in microglia morphology suggest changes in their function,
suggesting. Further analyses of stress susceptible versus resilient
animals, together with ultrastructural studies, will expand our understanding of KD on
microglial function. Ongoing analysis using scanning electron microscopy will allow us to
perform ultrastructural characterization of microglial function, their interactions with
other cell types, synaptic elements, as well as provide valuable intracellular information
regarding their phagocytic activity and markers of cellular stress..

Microglia as the main resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) have
critical, underappreciated roles in development and in the maintenance of brain homeostasis.
Microglia also become highly reactive throughout the course of all neurological disease
including multiple sclerosis. To gain a clear insight into the role of microglia in CNS
pathology we first need to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying development of
these cells. Further-more, it has been shown that animal model organisms consistently fail
to mimic human physiological conditions. In the present study, we performed whole,
single-cell RNA sequencing on 13,568 microglia isolated from surgical samples of second
trimester fetal, pediatric (18 months to 2 years old), adolescent (10 to 14 years old) and
adult (40 to 62 years old) brains. Using Seurat (v3) package to analyze the data we showed
there are multiple subtypes of microglia during human development contributing to a
continuum genes expression. We showed fetal microglia have a distinct transcriptomic
expression profile compared to all post-natal samples. Based on the transcriptional
signatures we predict fetal cells to have a higher phagocytic capacity than microglia from
other ages while postnatal microglia have a greater proinflammatory gene signature and this
increases with age. Moreover, we revealed the adolescent derived microglia were
transcriptionally distinct from pediatric and adult cells, and they exhibited the most
metabolically active transcriptomic profile. Finally, we correlated our findings about human
microglia with mouse microglia datasets from the literature and observe that in spite of
high correlation between human and mouse, microglia samples cluster according to their
species and not according to developmental age. To understand the diverse function of human
microglia during disease we must first gain insight into the gene expression programs that
underlie each stage of normal development. This study is a valuable resource to explore
transcriptional changes of human microglia during development at the single cell level..

IF YOU GIVE A FLY A COMPLEMENT: INVESTIGATING THE GLIAL RESPONSE TO CNS INSULT AND
INJURY
.

Matthew Boisvert, Mary Logan.


Oregon Health and Science University, Neurology, Portland, USA

The complement system is a highly conserved signaling cascade that targets pathogens and
apoptotic cells for removal by systemic immune cells. Recent work reveals that complement
factors (e.g., C1q, C3, C4b) play important roles in glial-dependent synaptic refinement and
are characteristically expressed in glia during central nervous system injury. Reactive glia
mediate the brain's response and recovery after a wide variety of insults and injury, and
glia-derived complement components consistently increase in everything from aging and
neurodegeneration to traumatic brain injury and stroke. Complement inhibition attenuates
some glial reactivity and neuro-degeneration-related synaptic and behavioral deficits, but
the role of this pathway in the glial injury response is largely opaque. To further explore
how the brain mediates damage, this work establishes Drosophila
melanogaster as a model to examine complement-like pathways in reactive glia.
Flies display a robust glial injury response, with a short generation time and bounty of
genetic tools making them a vital paradigm to examine the basic mechanisms of glial
reactivity. My analyses indicate that fly thioester-containing protein (TEP) family members
Tep2 and Tep4 share ∼40% protein sequence similarity with the secreted mammalian C3 and C4b
complement factors, with conservation in important functional domains. This work reveals
that Tep2 and 4 are expressed by glial cells and are elevated in multiple paradigms of
central nervous system injury. Furthermore, Tep2/4 localize around the site of axonal
injury, and glial Tep knockdown inhibits axonal degeneration. I hypothesize that Drosophila
Teps play mammalian complement-like roles in the fly brain and are involved in glial injury
response. Overall, this project investigates glial complement-like functionality in the
brain, parsing apart the roles these Teps play in reactive glia and injury, focusing on
their impact and interactors..

Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) are ubiquitous, swelling-activated chloride
channels, which regulate cell volume and participate in other cellular functions.
Physiological roles for VRACs in the brain remain poorly understood. We and others reported
100% lethality and behavioral seizures in mice with brain-specific deletion of the essential
VRAC subunit LRRC8A. Here, we used EEG and video recordings to explore frequency and
characteristics of seizures and establish their potential link to mortality LRRC8A-null
animals. Lrrc8a
flox/flox mice were bred with Nestin-Cre+ animals to produce
brain-wide LRRC8A knockouts (KO), heterozygotes (Het), and Lrrc8a
flox/+ and Lrrc8a
flox/flox controls. Western blotting showed complete loss of LRRC8A protein in
KO. Cortical EEG electrodes were implanted at 5-6 weeks, and individually housed animals
were recorded until the age of 10-12 weeks (controls) or time of death (KO). In the initial
study, we found 100% mortality in KO during early to late adolescence (5-9 weeks) with
frequent behavioral seizures. In the present longitudinal EEG work, all KO mice showed
moderate-to-severe EEG and behavioral seizure activity (n=6). In striking contrast, no EEG
abnormalities or behavioral seizures were present in fl/+, fl/fl, or Het littermates
(n=6/group). Unlike other genotypes, KO did not build nests. Four out of six KO mice died,
with three of them having seizure preceding the death, one animal died without a coinciding
EEG seizure, and two animals remain under observation. In conclusion, we determined that all
KO animals with brain-wide deletion of the essential VRAC subunit LRRC8A develop spontaneous
seizures. These findings point to an unexpected and previously unknown critical role for
LRRC8A anion channels in the regulation of brain excitability..

TRANSCRIPTIONAL AND TRANSLATIONAL REGULATION

Neuronal circuit development is a complex process consisting of precise steps in the
directional growth and maturation of axons and dendrites to synapse formation and
elimination. The development of axons and dendrites, in particular, is largely dependent on
extra-cellular guidance cues. The large family of Semaphorin molecular cues is known to
regulate axon guidance, dendrite elaboration and synapse elimination in the developing
mammalian nervous system. In particular, the class 3 secreted Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A),
through its receptor complex Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1)/PlexinA4 (PlxnA4), has been shown to induce
dendritic elaboration in cortical neurons in vitro and in
vivo. Previously, we showed that the KRK amino acid motif in the PlxnA4 receptor
is required for cortical dendritic elaboration through the interaction with the RhoGEF FARP2
and activation of Rac1. However, it is not known whether other signaling motifs in the
PlxnA4 receptor could also mediate dendrite development. Here, we show that the LVS motif,
located in the Rho GTPase binding domain of PlxnA4, is required for Sema3A-mediated
dendritic elaboration in cortical neurons. Moreover, our findings show for the first time
that gene transcription and protein translation are required in Sema3A-induced dendritic
elaboration of cortical neurons in vitro during the initial stages of
dendritic elaboration, but not later stages. Next, we will identify novel downstream gene
targets of Sema3A-induced dendrite elaboration by using RNA sequencing in our established
primary cortical neuron system and in vivo using specific genetically
modified mouse lines. Taken together, our study provides novel insights to the intracellular
mechanisms underlying Sema3A-mediated dendritic morphogenesis in cortical neuron
development, and dissects the multifunctional roles of the PlxnA4 receptor in the proper
formation of neuronal connections..

Glioblastoma is a deadly malignant tumor that originates from abnormal astrocytes in the
brain and, less commonly, in the spinal cord. It is characterized by rapid recurrence after
surgery, resistance to treatment, and high mortality rate. The location of the tumor, the
heterogenous nature of the disease, and the accumulation of multiple mutations in tumor
suppressors contribute to therapy resistance and recurrence. Autophagy is a self-eating and
recycling process of the damaged cellular components and organelles, providing a survival
mechanism to the aggressive tumors that grow in stressful micro-environments such as
nutrient deficiency and hypoxia. Targeting autophagy in glioblastoma is now widely accepted
to be a promising therapeutic strategy. Recombinant proteins, dietary supplements, or
natural compounds have shown anti-tumor effects in glioblastoma and other cancers. However,
glioblastoma rapidly develops resistance to a single therapy. A synergistic combination
therapy could provide better growth inhibitory effects on glioblastoma, showing the efficacy
at lower doses and causing less damages to the adjacent normal cells. Bone morphogenetic
protein 4 (BMP4) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) family of
multi-function proteins. BMP4 plays a critical role during nervous system development and
maturation and it is found to be down regulated in glio-blastoma leading to poor outcomes,
while treating glioblastoma cells with recombinant BMP4 has shown promising antitumor
actions. Luteolin (LTL) is a flavonoid found in several plants and it has antioxidant,
neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory, and tumor inhibitory properties. We aimed to investigate
the synergistic anti-tumor efficacy of BMP4 and LTL in two human glioblastoma cell lines
(U87MG with p53 wild-type and U251 with p53 mutant-type), targeting autophagy flux in
nutrient-deficient growth medium. Our study designed to show that targeting autophagy with
synergistic combination of BMP4 and LTL caused morphological and molecular changes
(Beclin-1, LC3 II, and p62) leading to disparate levels of growth inhibition due to
dissimilar status of the tumor suppressor p53 in the glioblastoma cell lines..

All mammalian cells sense and respond to insufficient oxygen, or hypoxia, through the
activity of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), an evolutionarily conserved family of
transcriptional regulators that promote oxygen-independent energy metabolism and
angiogenesis. While HIF activation is transiently protective for all cells, prolonged HIF
activity drives distinct pathological responses in different tissues and exerts a powerful
influence over fate decisions in a multitude of progenitor and stem cell types. How HIFs
achieve this pleiotropic effect is largely unknown. In the central nervous system (CNS),
prolonged HIF accumulation blocks myelin development as seen in stroke, premature birth, and
subsets of cerebral palsy. Here, we demonstrate that HIF1a activates unique non-canonical
targets to impair the function of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to generate
oligodendrocytes, a glial subtype of the CNS responsible for myelin formation. Beyond the
canonical hypoxia response targets shared between all cell types, HIF1a activated a unique
set of gene targets in OPCs through interaction with the OPC-specific transcription factor
OLIG2. These non-canonical targets, including Ascl2 and
Dlx3, when ectopically expressed were sufficient to block
oligo-dendrocyte development through suppression of the key oligodendro-cyte regulator
Sox10. Chemical screening of 1,800 bioactive compounds revealed that
inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling overcame the HIF1a-mediated block in oligodendrocyte
generation by restoring Sox10 expression without impacting canonical HIF1a
activity. MEK/ ERK inhibition also drove oligodendrocyte formation in hypoxic regions of
human oligocortical spheroids. Collectively, this work defines the mechanism by which HIF1a
impairs oligodendrocyte formation. More broadly, we establish that cell-type-specific HIF1a
targets, independent of the canonical hypoxia response, can developmentally or
pathologically perturb cell function in response to low oxygen..

During neonatal and early postnatal brain development, progenitors from the Subventricular
Zone (SVZ) can give rise to neurons and glia that contribute to the development of the
cortex, corpus callosum and olfactory bulb. Independent studies have shown that
neurotrophins, a family of growth factors, can influence many aspects of neuronal and glial
stem cell development including proliferation, differentiation, migration and quiescence. We
found that the pan neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, is expressed by a subpopulation of
nestin-expressing progenitor cells in the dorsolateral SVZ (dSVZ) throughout the postnatal
development of rats from ages P1-P21. We also observed increased expression of p75NTR
between the ages P7-P10, which coincides with the period of gliogenesis during development,
however the role of p75NTR in the postnatal rat dSVZ during this period remains unexplored.
We aim to understand the role of p75NTR in influencing the progenitor population in the dSVZ
by characterizing the p75NTR expressing cells in vivo and isolating and
comparing the proliferation and differentiation capabilities of the p75NTR-expressing cells
with cells of the dSVZ that lack p75NTR, and dSVZ cells isolated from a p75NTR KO rat. We
find that the absence of p75NTR reduces the proliferative capacity of neuro-spheres cultured
from the SVZ and promotes differentiation of progenitor cells along the oligodendrocyte
lineage..

REGULATION OF SYSTEM XC-EXPRESSION IN CORTICAL ASTROCYTES BY ARSENITE

Millions of people in the United States are exposed chronically to inorganic arsenic,
mostly in the form of arsenite, through drinking water. Because arsenite can be transported
by phosphate and glucose permeases, it can cross the blood-brain barrier and enter
astrocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), where is has been shown to have negative
effects. Numerous studies demonstrate that arsenite generates oxidative stress in various
cell types, though whether this occurs in astrocytes has yet to be definitively determined.
This may be because astrocytes contain a large and essential reservoir of the antioxidant
glutathione (GSH). Increased production of oxidized GSH occurs upon its consumption to
reduced GSSG, a process dependent on the activity of system xc−, a
cystine/glutamate antiporter that imports the rate-limiting substrate, cyst(e)ine. Our lab
previously demonstrated that exposure of astrocytes to arsenite increases steady-state mRNA
expression of the system xc− substrate-specific light chain, xCT,
through a transcriptional mechanism. Further, astrocytic arsenite exposure increased both
astrocyte-derived GSH and GSSG. Thus, we posit that arsenite enhances astrocytic xCT
expression through its production of ROS. To test this, primary cortical astrocyte cultures
were treated for four hours with sodium arsenite (15 µM) alone or with sodium arsenite
(15 µM) plus the antioxidant idebenone (30 µM), after which xCT mRNA expression was
determined via qPCR ΔΔCt analysis. The rapid redox cycling drug menadione (30 µM)±idebenone
(30 µM) was used as positive control. Data thus far demonstrate that treatment with arsenite
and menadione increases astrocytic xCT mRNA production, and that idebenone treatment
inhibits this increase. These data are consistent with the idea that arsenite produces an
increase in ROS in astrocytes that regulates the expression of system xc
− in order to enhance antioxidant production. Supported by NINDS R01

The accumulation of extracellular plaques in the brain is a signature feature of
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The plaques, primarily composed of aggregated amyloid-β peptide
(Aβ), create an inflammatory environment involving immune cells such as microglia.
Activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in microglia by oligomeric Aβ aggregates,
such as protofibrils, triggers an innate immune response leading to the release of
inflammatory mediators that contribute to disease progression and severity. Numerous studies
have demonstrated the involvement of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptors cluster
differentiation 14 (CD14) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in Aβ mediated neuroinflammation.
LPS is a toxic outer-leaflet component of gram-negative bacteria. We hypothesized that
compounds with potential LPS inhibitory effect can be equally effective for the inhibition
of Aβ mediated neuroinflammation. Previous work from our laboratory identified the
monosaccharide, Lipid A analog AM-12 as a potent antagonist of LPS-induced inflammation.
AM-12 possesses a glucopyranoside core, lipid chains connected by ether linkages, and an
Fmoc-protected amino acid to add ionic character. A new series of AM-12 derivatives was
tested for LPS antagonistic activity in human THP1 macrophages. The compounds were effective
inhibitors and did not display toxicity or agonistic activity. This new class of compounds
contained changes at the amino acid carboxy terminus and the functional group in the
glucopyranoside ring. The presence of a hydrogen acceptor group at the 4-position of the
ring improved the antagonistic activity of the compounds. Furthermore, the original AM-12
compound inhibited Aβ42 protofibril-mediated inflammation in THP macrophages. Another class
of compounds comprised of anomeric lactones with varying length of the nonpolar ether-linked
side chain at the 2- and 3- position also inhibited LPS induced inflammation in a
concentration dependent manner. However, the chain length also played a role in causing
toxicity to the THP1 macrophages. It is hoped that the continuing studies will produce
sugar-based compounds that effectively block LPS and Aβ-triggered inflammation..

PHARMACOGENETIC INHIBITION OF AFFERENT EXCITABILITY ALLEVIATES VEGF-INDUCED VISCERAL
HYPERSENSITIVITY IN A MOUSE MODEL OF UCPPS

Patients with urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) experience chronic pelvic
pain (CPP) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The UCPPS symptoms are closely
associated with nociceptive sensitization in the nervous system, which underlies visceral
allodynia and hyperalgesia. Previous studies suggested that afferent hypersensitivity in
bladder-projecting sensory neurons plays an important role in the generation and the
maintenance of UCPPS symptoms, especially bladder pain and urinary frequency. In this study,
we tested the hypothesis that visceral hypersensitivity and the symptoms of UCPPS could
alleviated by pharmacogenetic inhibition of sensory neuronal excitability in a mouse model
of UCPPS. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level is correlated with CPP in UCPPS
patients, and in animal models of bladder overactivity. Intravesical instillation of
VEGF165 induced nociceptive sensitization and bladder nerve remodeling in both
male and female C57BL6/J mice. Bladder overactivity and pain were evaluated by in
vivo cystometry and Von Frey assay, respectively. To directly manipulate afferent
sensitivity, Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs
(DREADDs) were expressed in bladder-projecting sensory neurons via targeted adeno-associated
viral vector (AAV) injections. Transgenic mice expressing Cre-recombinase and fluorescence
reporters in bladder sensory neurons and afferent nerves were used to guide cellular
expression of DREADDs as well as to reveal the potential nerve remodeling via neuroimaging.
We found that VEGF165 induced sensory nerve remodeling in the urinary bladder,
bladder overactivity, and visceral mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia. The
VEGF165-induced symptoms were likely due to VEGF receptor signaling-mediated
upregulation of nociceptors in bladder sensory nerves. Pharmacogenetic inhibition of
bladder-projecting sensory neurons using DREADDs significantly attenuated
VEGF165-induced visceral mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia and alleviated the
symptoms of bladder overactivity. Our data suggests a functional role for VEGF signaling in
peripheral sensory neurons in a murine model of UCPPS. Further investigation of the
molecular targets in VEGF signaling pathways in bladder sensory neurons will shed lights on
alternative treatments for UCPPS..

Each year millions of Americans will suffer either a traumatic injury to the brain or to
the spinal cord. At present, there is no effective cure. It is clear that an effective
treatment will have to be multifactored focusing on a wide range of issues. One major factor
that needs to be addressed is the ongoing neuroinflammation triggered by the injury,
evidence of which can be detected months to years following the initial insult. Prolonged
inflammation can lead to continued loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes and consequently
loss of function. A major player in the inflammatory response is the microglia, the brain's
resident immune cells. Microglia are highly ramified at “rest” but change into rounded
phagocytic cells following injury. The mechanism associated with this activation and
morphological change is not completely understood. We have recently demonstrated that the
polarity protein Par1b/MARK2 (DiBona et al 2019) may be instrumental in the inflammatory
response. Par1b/MARK2 is a serine/thionine kinase and is a member of Par1/MARK (microtubule
affinity regulating kinase) family of polarity proteins. Par1/MARK proteins are noted for
their roles in regulating a number of cellular processes within the brain including neuronal
migration, dendritic development and spine formation. The loss of Par1b/MARK2 facilitates
the microglial inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo
following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice. In order to better understand the mechanisms
of injury-induced inflammation, we are examining downstream effectors of Par1b/ MARK2. One
candidate is the class IIa histone deacetylases (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7 and HDAC9). Par1b/MARK2
has been shown to regulate cellular localization, and function of with class IIa HDACs
through N-terminal phosphorylation (Dequiedt et al 2006). HDAC7 activity plays and important
role in macrophage immune responses (Shakespeare et al 2013 and Gupta et al 2020). We have
found intense immunoreactivity of microglia at the focal injury site in the brains of mice
subjected to TBI. Interestingly, reactive astro-cytes response similarly show strong
immunoreactivity for HDAC7..

Objective: Despite extensive research on epileptogenesis, current medications only provide
symptomatic control of seizures. Thus, there is high demand in the investigation of new
mechanisms and approaches for the development of treatments for 30% of epilepsy cases that
prove drug resistant. Inflammation, neural loss, plasticity, mossy fibre sprouting and
blood–brain barrier dysfunction are the most common causes of epileptogenesis. Increasing
evidence supports that transforming growth factor (TGF-β) /non-SMAD pathway is of utmost
importance in neuroinflammation mediated epileptogenesis. Therefore, exploring TGF-β
/non-SMAD pathway could provide an interesting opportunity to discover and validate targets
for novel therapeutics for controlling pharmacoresistant epilepsies. Methodology: Male
Balb/c mice were categorized into 5 groups i.e., normal-control, Pentylenetetrazole-control,
drug control (diazepam and valproic acid) and test group i.e., Isoxylitone (E/Z-2-
propanone-1,3,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-ylidine) abbreviated as (ISOX). Kindling was
induced by giving sub-convulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 40 mg/kg) every alternate
day until seizure score 5 develops in the PTZ-control group. Treatments were given to
respective groups 30 min prior to PTZ dose. When animals acquired consistent score 5 for at
least 3days, experiments were terminated and brain samples i.e., cortex and hippocampus were
isolated for further gene expression studies. Result: The experimental findings revealed
that ISOX (30 mg/kg) not only significantly suppressed the PTZ-induced seizures but also
halted the epileptogenesis by altering the non-SMAD associated TGF-β genes. ISOX
pre-treatment significantly upregulated the RhoA, ROCK2 and AKT expressions and
downregulated the ROCK1, MAPK14, and NFkB expressions as compared to PTZ-control group in
hippocampus region, suggesting the disease modifying effect of ISOX and other treatments in
epileptogenesis. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that non-SMAD/ TGF-β signaling pathway act
as critical target in epilepsy, and also rationalizes the ISOX as a promising newer
neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and disease-modifying agent in forestalling the
epileptogenesis.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative demyelinating disorder that impairs neuronal
function in the brain and spinal cord. The incidence of MS has been increasing worldwide
over the past decades, but no drug is currently available to provide a definitive cure.
Studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS, have
provided convincing evidence that T cells specific for self-antigens mediate pathology in
this disease. Interactions between the major histocompatibility complex II (containing
antigenic peptides) and the T cell receptor activate CD4+ T cells that perpetuate EAE and
MS. Increased calcium activated neutral proteinase (calpain) activity has been observed in
MS and EAE; in addition, calpain is implicated in the activation of T cells (Th1/Th17),
degradation of myelin proteins, and T cell chemotaxis. Inhibiting calpain has been shown to
reduce these activities. While calpain is activated in brain and spinal cord of MS patients,
the precise involvement of the two calpain isoforms, calpain-1 and calpain- 2, remains
poorly defined. Studies in our lab suggest that calpain-2 expression is significantly
increased in brain and spinal cord postmortem tissues of MS patients as compared to
calpain-1. Current MS therapies (with various side effects) target immunomodulation, but
have only modest effects in attenuating the immunologic and neuro-degenerative components of
the disease. Since axon/myelin degeneration is implicated in the resulting disability in
progressive cases of MS, development of novel therapeutic strategies directed toward both
inflammation and neurodegenerative processes is imperative. Our study demonstrates that
elevated levels of calpain expression/ activity and reactive oxygen species are detected in
human microglia cells; these findings are attenuated following calpain inhibitor treatment.
Thus, calpain inhibitors may be employed as future therapeutic agents for treating MS
symptoms, and distinct calpain isoforms may be useful as biomarkers for MS. Supported in
part by grants from the SCIRF and the Veterans Administration..

SEASONAL CHANGES IN ADK IN TANYCYTES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SEASONAL CHANGES IN
PURINERGIC SIGNALING THAT UNDERLIE HIBERNATION

Hibernation is a seasonal strategy to conserve energy, characterized by modified
thermoregulation, an increase in sleep pressure and drastic metabolic changes. Glial cells
such as astrocytes and tanycytes are the brain metabolic sensors but it remains unknown
whether they contribute to seasonal expression of hibernation. The onset of hibernation is
controlled by an undefined endogenous circannual rhythm in which adenosine plays a role
through the activation of the adenosine A1 receptor (A1AR). Seasonal
changes in brain tissue levels of adenosine may contribute to an increase in A1AR
agonist sensitivity leading to the onset of hibernation. The primary regulator of
extracellular adenosine concentration is adeno-sine kinase (ADK), which is located in
astrocytes. Moreover, tanycytes the other glial cells of interest are known to regulate
seasonal change in phenotypes in other species. We asked if a seasonal change in ADK in
hypothalamic astrocytes or periventricular tanycytes was associated with seasonal
A1AR agonist sensitivity. We collected Arctic ground squirrel
(Urocitellus parryii) brain tissue in summer, fall and winter after
intracardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemical analysis. We used a
mouse anti-vimentin antibody (1:1000, Millipore, MA Cat# MAB3400, RRID:AB_94843 ) to
identify tanycytes and a rabbit anti-ADK to identify astrocytes (ADK, 1:4000, Bethyl
Laboratories, TX Cat# A304-280A, RRID:AB_2620476 ). We performed immuno-histochemistry for
seasonal groups in parallel and quantified ADK fluoresence intensity. We compared tanycyte
morphology and ADK expression within two brain regions involved in energy homeostasis, the
hypothalamus and the area postrema. We found seasonal changes in tanycyte morphology in the
hypothalamus. We also observed for the first time the presence of ADK in tanycyte cell
bodies, and we observed a seasonal change in ADK expression in tanycytes but not in
astrocytes. Although still speculative, our findings contribute to a model whereby adenosine
kinase in tanycytes regulates seasonal changes in extracellular concentration of adenosine
underling the seasonal expression of hibernation..

The combined cranial radiation- (RT) and chemo-therapy (temozolomide, TMZ) are the standard
of care for brain cancer treatment. Unfortunately, clinical RT-TMZ treatment has been linked
with debilitating cognitive decline. This is particularly a pressing problem for the grade
II/III glioblastoma and childhood brain cancer survivors who often live long post-treatment
and endure persistent RT-induced cognitive deficits (RICD) with no clinical recourse. Our
data showed that acute RICD was accompanied by elevated astrogliosis. Among other
gliotransmitters, astrocytes regulate the synaptic adenosine pools, an endogenous
neuroprotectant, and modulator of cognition, via metabolic clearance through the cytosolic
adenosine kinase (ADK). In the adult brain, astrocytes are the predominant source of ADK. We
have shown the prevention of RICD and astrogliosis by pharmacologic inhibition of ADK. To
elucidate the astrocyte-specific mechanism of adenosine modulation, we utilized the
rAAV-based Adk-miRNA vector (Adk-KD) to study its impact on the brain exposed to clinically
relevant RT-TMZ treatment. Under the GfaABC1D promoter, the rAAV vector was designed to
knock down astrocytic ADK and provide a powerful tool to mechanistically understand the
impact of RT-TMZ. Adult WT mice receiving RT-TMZ (fractionated RT, 8.67 Gy x3 doses+adjuvant
TMZ, 25 mg/kg) and intra-hippocampal injections of the scrambled vector showed a significant
decline in the memory consolidation and cognitive function tasks (novel object or place
recognition, fear extinction memory) 6 weeks post-RT-TMZ. Irradiated brains showed elevated
ADK immunoreactivity linked with hypertrophic astrocytes. Conversely, mice receiving the
Adk-KD vector 1-week post-RT-TMZ showed significantly improved cognitive function 6-weeks
post-exposure. The Adk-KD vector selectively transduced astrocytes and knocked down
(>80%) ADK throughout the brain, attenuated RT-TMZ-induced astrogliosis, and increases in
A1, and A2a receptor expression. The astrocyte-selective gene silencing approach provides
direct evidence supporting our hypothesis that cranial RT-TMZ disrupts adenosine metabolism,
and interventions targeted to reduce astrocytic ADK may prove beneficial to ameliorate brain
cancer therapy-induced cognitive dysfunction..

Life expectancy keeps increasing worldwide, yet the current average healthy life years is
predicted to be around 64. One of the most impactful consequences of aging is a
deterioration of cognitive functions that rely on proper hippocampal function. Investigating
ways to maintain cognition during aging has therefore become a public health priority..

We show that mice lacking xCT (xCT−/-), the functional subunit of the
cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc-, live longer than their wildtype
littermates (xCT+/+). Moreover, at 18 months, xCT−/- mice have
preserved cognitive functions when analyzing the performance of both genotypes in the Barnes
maze task, contrary to xCT+/+ mice. To investigate possible mechanisms through
which xCT deletion retains memory function, we performed untargeted metabolomics analysis on
hippocampus of adult (3m old) and aged (18m old) xCT+/+ and xCT−/-
mice..

The metabolic profile of adult xCT+/+ and xCT−/- mice shows limited
differences, yet random forest classification analysis reveals a distinct metabolome when
mice age in the absence of xCT. The key differences are observed in several groups of
glycerolipids, sphingo-lipids and in one-carbon metabolism..

Non-enzymatic post-translational modifications such as glycation and carbamylation, are
known to be increased with aging and negatively affect cellular functions. In our study,
levels of carbo-xymethyllysine, a marker of advanced glycation end products, are
significantly lower in both adult and aged xCT−/- mice, compared to age-matched
xCT+/+ controls. Homocitrulline, a marker of carbamylation, shows an overall
increase in the hippocampus of aged compared to adult mice and this effect is most prominent
in xCT+/+ mice. Furthermore, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine -involved in
learning and memory - and the sulfate ester of the hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA-S)
-having anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic capacities-are significantly increased with
aging; an effect that is driven by the xCT−/- mice. Overall, these results show
several metabolic changes in the hippocampus of aged xCT−/- mice that could
explain preservation of hippocampal function..

IF YOU GIVE A FLY A COMPLEMENT: INVESTIGATING THE GLIAL RESPONSE TO CNS INSULT AND
INJURY
.

Matthew Boisvert, Mary Logan.


Oregon Health and Science University, Neurology, Portland, USA

The complement system is a highly conserved signaling cascade that targets pathogens and
apoptotic cells for removal by systemic immune cells. Recent work reveals that complement
factors (e.g., C1q, C3, C4b) play important roles in glial-dependent synaptic refinement and
are characteristically expressed in glia during central nervous system injury. Reactive glia
mediate the brain's response and recovery after a wide variety of insults and injury, and
glia-derived complement components consistently increase in everything from aging and
neurodegeneration to traumatic brain injury and stroke. Complement inhibition attenuates
some glial reactivity and neuro-degeneration-related synaptic and behavioral deficits, but
the role of this pathway in the glial injury response is largely opaque. To further explore
how the brain mediates damage, this work establishes Drosophila
melanogaster as a model to examine complement-like pathways in reactive glia.
Flies display a robust glial injury response, with a short generation time and bounty of
genetic tools making them a vital paradigm to examine the basic mechanisms of glial
reactivity. My analyses indicate that fly thioester-containing protein (TEP) family members
Tep2 and Tep4 share ∼40% protein sequence similarity with the secreted mammalian C3 and C4b
complement factors, with conservation in important functional domains. This work reveals
that Tep2 and 4 are expressed by glial cells and are elevated in multiple paradigms of
central nervous system injury. Furthermore, Tep2/4 localize around the site of axonal
injury, and glial Tep knockdown inhibits axonal degeneration. I hypothesize that Drosophila
Teps play mammalian complement-like roles in the fly brain and are involved in glial injury
response. Overall, this project investigates glial complement-like functionality in the
brain, parsing apart the roles these Teps play in reactive glia and injury, focusing on
their impact and interactors..

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating condition that affects around 5.8 million of
Americans, and these numbers are projected to reach nearly 14 million individuals around
2050. Although AD was first described more than 100 years ago, until nowadays that are not
effective treatments to counteract or efficiently slow down the progression of the disease.
This is likely, due at least in part, to the fact that AD animal models have been focused in
the use of transgenic rodent models, failing to translate the findings to humans with the
disease. We describe here a non-human primate model of AD presenting extensive tau
pathology, mainly affecting the hippocampus and connected areas. Adult rhesus monkeys
injected with adeno-associated viruses expressing mutant tau (P301L/S320F) in the left
entorhinal cortex (ERC) show after 3 months, extensive prion-like tau propagation with full
fibrillary tangles in the hippocampus, as well as pre-tangles and phospho-tau in projection
areas such as the contralateral ERC and in the retrosplenial and visual cortices.
Importantly, neuroinflammation is extensive in the affected areas, with a major role of
microglia in pathological tau oligomer propagation. Finally, the mutant h4R injected
coaptates monkey 3R tau generating more tau aggregation and spreading. These results
highlight the first stages of tau pathology and propagation and support the importance of a
non-human model of AD, with natural full expression of tau protein, that is highly
translational to humans..

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a reduction in cerebral glucose metabolism, and
impaired glucose tolerance is also common in the periphery in AD. We detected aberrant
subcellular localization of the GLUT1 glucose transporter in cells of the cerebral
parenchyma in AD. Specifically, smaller fractions of GLUT1 were in the plasma membrane of
cells that expressed a 45-kDa version of the transporter. Endothelial cells express a 55-kDa
GLUT1, and this form of the protein was unaltered in AD, though its total levels were
reduced in type-2 diabetes. We found these AD-related manifestations present in a mouse line
that transgenically overexpresses human Aβ in the absence of an APP transgene. The 45-kDa
protein has often been attributed to astrocytes, but considerable expression can be found in
neurons as well. Astrocytes extend endfeet to the cerebrovasculature that are critical to
the transport of glucose from endothelium into the deeper brain parenchyma. And while the
lactate shuttle hypothesis posits that the fuel ultimately delivered to neurons is not
glucose, it is clear that glucose must be imported into astrocytes as an initial step. We
hypothesized that a drop in the functional amount of GLUT1 in astrocytes produces the
aberrations in glucose metabolism found in AD, including retention of enough glucose in the
blood to create peripheral glucose intolerance. To test this idea, we employed a conditional
knockdown (cKD) of one allele of the GLUT1 gene (Slc2a1) using a Cre/Lox
system wherein Cre is driven by a Gfap promoter. Gfap-cKD mice showed a
reduction in cerebral meta-bolism of glucose, as well as peripheral glucose intolerance.
These findings indicate that an impairment in roughly fifty percent of the glucose handled
by astrocytes in the CNS can create not only significant reduction of brain glucose
utilization but can also leave enough glucose in the blood to present with impaired glucose
tolerance..

Background: Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathogenesis involves α- synuclein
accumulation, but also impaired insulin sensitivity, characterized by decreased Tyr and Ser
insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS- 1) phosphorylations. Some PD patients develop mild
cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) or dementia (PD-D), partially from co-existing Alzheimer's
disease (AD) pathology. Given its importance for disease prognosis, there is a need to
develop biomarkers for distinguishing PD normal cognition (PD-N) from PD-MCI/D.
Neuronal-origin extracellular vesicles (NEVs) contain pathogenic proteins and insulin
signaling mediators..

Methods: From 104 PD-N, 83 PD-MCI, and 39 PD-D patients and 48 age/sex-matched
Controls, we immunocaptured plasma NEVs using anti-L1CAM antibody. We performed
electro-chemiluminescence immunoassays for: 1) pathogenic proteins (α- synuclein,
amyloid-beta42, total and p181-tau); 2) insulin-signaling markers (pTyr20/pSer312-IRS-1, and
mTOR/pmTOR)..

Results: α-synuclein was lower in PD than Controls (p<0.01), decreased
stepwise in PD-MCI and PD-D compared to PD-N (p<0.01), and tended to decrease with
increasing motor symptom severity by MDS-UPDRS-III (p=0.06). Amyloid-beta42 trended towards
being higher in PD-MCI and PD-D compared to PD-N (p=0.06). pTau181 was higher in PD patients
than Controls (p<0.01) and in PD-MCI compared to PD-N (p<0.05) and tended to increase
with MDS-UPDRS-III (p=0.09). Total Tau was not different between groups. pTyr20-IRS-1 was
lower in PD than Controls and in PD-MCI compared to PD-N (p<0.05) and decreased with
increasing MDS-UPDRS-III (p<0.01). The ratio pSer312/pTyr20-IRS-1 was higher in PD
patients than Controls (p<0.05), and in PD-MCI (p<0.05) compared to PD-N..

Conclusions: PD patients with cognitive impairment exhibited lower NEV
α-synuclein and pTyr20-IRS-1 and higher pTau181 levels than cognitively intact PD patients.
Additionally, α-synuclein and pTyr20- IRS-1 were associated with PD motor symptom severity.
Plasma NEVs are a valuable tool for discovering biomarkers in PD..

ROLE OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES IN C9ORF72-ALS
.

ALS is a neurodegenerative disease affecting upper and lower motor neurons. The most common
ALS mutation is the G4C2 expansion in the C9orf72.
The toxic mechanisms associated to G4C2 expansion are formation of
nuclear RNA foci and aberrant repeats associated non-AUG (RAN) translation of five different
dipeptide proteins (DPRs) : polyGA, polyGP, polyGR, polyPA, polyPR; the highest toxicity is
associated to polyPR and polyGR. All the DPRs are loaded into the extracellular vesicles
(EVs) which are organelles continuously released from cells mainly grouped into
microvesicles and exosomes. In this work we studied toxicity associated to the production of
DPR+ EVs and which pathological pathways are associated to their
internalization. By a transwell system we put in not-direct contact NSC34 transiently
transfected with plasmids expressing DPRs and rat primary cortical neurons (CNs) transfected
with synapsin-driven TdTomato to follow them over time by live imaging. We found a
significant decrease in viability of CNs that were in contact with NSC34 overexpressing
polyGR with 50 repeats (GR50). To understand the contribution of polyGR EVs, we isolated EVs
from culture media of NSC34 transfected with GR50 by ultracentrifugation: GR50 was present
in both microvesicles and exosomes. When the EVs were added to the CNs media, we found that
only polyGR+ exosomes population was able to recapitulate the toxicity observed
in the transwell experiment. To directly prove the contribution of polyGR+ EVs,
we inhibited the production of EVs in NSC34 with GW4869 and we performed the transwell
experiment observing that the polyGR associated toxicity was abolished. We further
investigated the contribution of different polyGR lengths finding that EVs loaded with GR100
caused an even bigger decrease in recipient CNs viability. We investigate if the reception
of DPR+ EVs was also able to trigger the activation of known pathological
mechanisms such as TDP43 mislocalization and RAN-translation activation; they both appear to
be enhanced in neurons treated with GR50 EVs. In conclusion we showed that the production of
EVs from ALS-affected neurons is a mechanism that can enhance and exacerbate the progression
of ALS..

CELL TYPE-SPECIFIC DELETIONS OF TFEB/TFE3 IN THE REGULATION OF BRAIN
HOMEOSTASIS
.

Henri Antikainen, Radek Dobrowolski, Haesun Kim.


Rutgers University, Biology, Newark, USA

Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a central regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy
that along with its MiT/TFE family members responds to nutrient signaling and cellular
stress. TFEB can promote brain homeostasis as seen in studies where neuronal and astrocytic
overexpression of TFEB ameliorates outcomes in neuro-degenerative models. In prolonged
cellular stress TFEB can promote cell death via integrated stress signaling. We have
previously described an Alzheimer's disease-like phenotype with neuronal death and
aggregating toxic proteins such as beta-amyloid and phospho-tau in TFEB fl/fl-nestin cre
mice, which lack TFEB in neuronal progenitor cells. In this mouse line, three different
mature cell lineages are affected by the genetic manipulation: neurons, oligodendrocytes and
astrocytes. In the current study, we are examining the effects of TFEB loss in each of these
cells types and their contributions to the disease-like phenotype. Oligodendrocytes do not
appear to be affected by the loss of TFEB, as seen by their retained myelination capability
in TFEB fl/fl-nestin cre mice. Astrocytes are more reactive in TFEB fl/fl-nestin cre in the
corpus callosum, striatum and cortical layers. We are using astrocyte-specific TFEB and
global TFE3 knockout mice to test whether the loss of astrocytic TFEB/TFE3 increases
astrocyte reactivity and pro-inflammatory signaling. We are also using the KO mouse line in
a traumatic brain injury model to determine effects of astrocytic TFEB/TFE3 loss on cellular
outcomes of TBI, such as neuronal and astrocyte death, accumulation of toxic proteins and
astrocyte and microglia reactivity..

A NOVEL STRATEGY TO IMAGE CALCIUM SIGNALING MECHANISMS OF NG2-GLIA FOLLOWING CNS VIRAL
INFECTION
.

University of Utah, Neuroscience, Pharmacology&Toxicology, Salt Lake City,

NG2-glia are commonly known as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. However, accumulating
evidence suggests that these cells have many additional functions, leading to their
classification as a major glial cell-type in their own right. We recently demonstrated that
NG2-glia become reactive, increase proliferation, and participate in scar formation in the
Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV) mouse model of infection-induced epilepsy.
To investigate functional changes that may accompany NG2-glia reactive processes, we
generated a triple-transgenic mouse to express a fluorescent reporter (tdTomato) and a
genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP6f) under control of an inducible NG2-promoter.
This provides a novel approach to investigate damage-associated changes in calcium signaling
in NG2-glia. Mice homozygous for tamoxifen-inducible cre and floxed-tdTomato were bred to
mice homozygous for floxed-GCaMP6f to produce mice that are heterozygous for all three
genes. Tamoxifen was administered (20mg/kg, i.p. in peanut oil, every-other-day for a total
of three injections) to induce tdTomato and GCaMP6f expression specifically in NG2-glia.
Time-series images were acquired using a 2-Photon microscope in coronal hippo-campal brain
slices at least 60µM below the surface. Imaging rates were optimized between 1-5 Hz to
monitor both spontaneous calcium transients and those evoked by the focal ATP (100uM)
application. Both spontaneous and ATP-induced calcium transients were consistently observed
in NG2-glia in the hippocampus of acutely prepared brain slices. While the application of
ACSF alone did not induce pressure-sensitive calcium transients in NG2-glia, ATP application
resulted in robust and reproducible calcium transients throughout both the soma and fine
processes of NG2-glia (1-3 slices from n= 5 mice). Our approach provides a novel strategy to
better understand the roles of NG2-glia in inflammatory states and in epilepsy development.
We show that NG2-glia react to purinergic damage signals (ATP) through transient increases
in intracellular calcium. Future work will determine whether calcium signaling is altered
following TMEV infection at timepoints known to induce reactive changes in NG2-glia..

Prolonged infection and inflammation within the brain can alter the connectivity and
function of neuronal circuits. The intracellular para-site, Toxoplasma
gondii, is one pathogen that can chronically infect the brain and lead to
encephalitis and seizures. Currently, 1 in 3 humans are infected with Toxoplasma
gondii worldwide, and these infections have been identified as a considerable
risk factor for developing complex neurological and psychiatric disorders that arise from
alterations in assembly and maintenance of synapses, such as schizophrenia. To directly
assess changes in inhibitory synapses, we employed Serial Block Face Scanning Electron
Microcopy and quantified perisomatic synapses in neocortex and hippocampus following
parasitic infection. Ultrastructural analyses, in combination with genetic and
immunohistochemical tools, revealed that persistent infection not only led to a significant
loss of inhibitory perisomatic synapses, it also induced the ensheathment of neuronal somata
and perisomatic nerve terminals by activated myeloid-derived cells (including microglia),
suggesting they may displace or phagocytose synaptic elements in long-term infection. How
might microglia contribute to inhibitory synapse loss in parasitic infection? Based on the
well-established role of the innate complement cascade contributing to synaptic refinement
in the developing brain and synapse loss in the diseased brain, we assessed complement
components in parasitic infection. Indeed, C1q and C3 are highly upregulated in neocortex
and hippocampus following persistent T. gondii infection. Therefore, we
hypothesized that these components may be required for microglia-induced synapse loss during
long-term infection. Using transgenic and knockout mouse models, our current studies
demonstrate that C3 is, in part, required for phagocytic microglia to ensheath neurons in
long-term infection, likely leading to the loss of inhibitory perisomatic synapses.
Together, these studies highlight novel ways in which immune molecules regulate neuron-glia
interactions to alter mature inhibitory circuits in parasitic brain infection..

Worldwide, 50 million people have epilepsy, a severe neurological disorder characterized by
recurrent seizures. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most prevalent form of acquired
epilepsy and difficult to control with available anti-seizure drugs. Thus, new
disease-modifying therapies are needed to treat and prevent seizures in high-risk groups.
Although the precise mechanisms that lead to epilepsy remain unclear, evidence from
experimental and clinical work suggests that inflammation is an important contributor. Brain
inflammation, induced by viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS), alters the
excitatory and inhibitory balance among neurons and is a significant cause of acute
seizures..

We have developed an experimental model of virus-induced seizures/ epilepsy, an animal
model of TLE. In our model, C57BL/6J mice infected intra-cranially with Theiler's murine
encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) develop encephalitis leading to acute seizures/epilepsy. We
found that infiltrating macrophages play a key role in seizure development. We isolated
infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia from the CNS of TMEV-infected mice and
performed RNA-seq to determine the expression profiles of genes relating to CNS
infection/inflammation. We identified new genes that are uniquely expressed by microglia or
macrophages during the peak of neuroinflammation, and the function of these
microglial-specific genes in the context of neuroinflammation is currently being explored.
We found a population of infiltrating macrophages that expresses high levels of TREM-1
(triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1). Activation of this receptor leads to the
initiation and amplification of inflammatory responses through the production and secretion
of inflammatory cytokines by these macrophages. We found that TREM-1 knockout mice have
decreased seizure incidence and severity. We also found that the CNS-infiltrating
macrophages had significantly diminished activation towards an inflammatory reactive state,
as shown by lower major histocompatibility complex-II expression, in mice treated with
TREM-1 inhibitor. We are continuing to explore the role of macrophages and microglial cells
leading to inflammation and seizures..

Myelin loss in brain is a common occurrence after traumatic brain injury (TBI) that results
from impact-induced acceleration forces to the head. Axons within the white matter tracts
are especially vulnerable to mechanical strain and subsequent axonal injury. Little is known
about the effect of mechanical strain on mature oligo-dendrocytes and their associated
myelin sheaths. We used an in vitro stretch device to characterize a
mechanotransduction mechanism that mediates the oligodendrocyte response to injury.
Stretch-injury caused transient and reversible myelin protein loss in oligodendro-cytes
without cell death. Biochemical analyses revealed that the stretch-induced myelin protein
loss was mediated by the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
consequent calcium-dependent activation of Erk1/2. Inhibition of Erk1/2 or ER calcium
release was sufficient to attenuate stretch-induced myelin protein loss in mature
oligodendrocytes. For in vivo studies, mild fluid percussion injury induced
Erk1/2 activation in mature oligo-dendrocytes of the corpus callosum within 24 hours, in
both focal and distal regions. Erk1/2 activation was accompanied by a decrease in the
CC1+ immunoreactivity within 3 days. Axonal degeneration was evident in the
focal but not the distal region, indicating that the loss of CC1+ cells in the
distal area occurred independent of Wallerian degeneration. A significant decrease in the
number of nodes of Ranvier was observed in both the distal and focal regions of the corpus
callosum and conversely, an increase in the appearance of hemi-nodes, which indicates a
disruption in the nodal-paranodal organization. Therefore, mild TBI elicits both focal and
diffuse effects on mature oligodendrocytes and myelin. More importantly, the impact of mild
TBI on the distal oligodendrocytes is manifested without oligodendrocyte death or axonal
loss, suggesting an oligo-dendrocyte intrinsic response that disrupts myelin
homeostasis..

Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is the most prevalent injury to the spinal cord, most
commonly resulting from car accidents. Direct injury to the spinal cord can cause immediate
loss of neural tissue, including neurons and glial cells. Severe direct injury leads to
permanent damage to the spinal cord at, above, and below the injury site, manifesting
autonomic dysfunction, respiratory problems, paralysis, or even death. Previous studies in
our laboratory indicated that SCI led to activation of multiple pathological pathways
contributing to secondary damage and induction of apoptotic death in SCI lesion and
penumbra. An earliest event in the pathogenesis in SCI is the increase in intracellular
calcium ion (Ca2+), which is one of the most critical intracellular messengers
that regulate multiple cellular functions in healthy and disease states. Similarly, bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) molecules, which are poly functional cytokines, are also
increased during SCI and correlated with impaired autophagy and increased neuronal and glial
death following injury. However, the link between intracellular Ca2+ overload and
elevated BMP signaling in pathogenesis in SCI remains largely unknown. In this study, we
aimed to understand the impact of inhibition of BMP signaling on Ca2+ mediated
apoptotic death in neurons and astrocytes in co-culture model of SCI. First, tried to
decipher how the intracellular Ca2+ overload affected the cell morphology and
survival in co-culture model of SCI. Second, we aimed to evaluate the impact of inhibition
of BMP signaling on survival and proliferation of both types. Next, we studied the molecular
mechanisms by which Ca2+ disrupted auto-phagy flux and how inhibition of BMP
signaling at an early stage of Ca2+ overload sustained autophagy flux and
prevented apoptotic death. In conclusion, our study suggested BMP signaling as a potential
therapeutic target in SCI for sustaining autophagy flux, protecting both neurons and
astrocytes from Ca2+ overload, and improving outcomes in SCI..

As concussion has become a common household topic, the seriousness of these mild traumatic
brain injuries (mTBI) has been lost in the general public. However, as scientists have
continued to dive deep into the study of pathology and physiology following mTBI it has been
found that the chronic pathology and behavioral dysfunction that is seen following a ‘mild’
TBI is anything but. Clinical-neuropathological correlation studies provide evidence that
conversion of tau into abnormally phosphorylated proteotoxic intermediates (p-tau) could be
part of the pathophysiology triggered by a single TBI and enhanced by repeated TBIs.
However, the link between p-tau and mTBI in rodents remains controversial. To address this
question experimentally, we induced a single or repetitive (two hit -2x) closed head injury
(CHI) to WT or rTg4510 mice. We found that 2xCHI increased tau phosphorylation in WT mice
and rTg4510 mice. Behavioral characterization in WT mice found chronic deficits in the
radial arm water maze in 2x CHI mice that had partially resolved in the 1x CHI mice.
Moreover, using Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging with R1 mapping – a novel
functional neuroimaging technique – we found greater deficits in the rTg4510 mice following
2x CHI compared to 1x CHI. To integrate our findings with prior work in the field, we
conducted a systematic review of rodent mild repetitive CHI studies. Following Prisma
guidelines, we identified 25 original peer-reviewed papers. Results from our experiments, as
well as our systematic review, provide compelling evidence that tau phosphorylation is
modified by experimental mild TBI studies; however, p-tau level changes are not universally
reported. Together, our results provide evidence that repetitive TBIs can result in worse
and more persistent neurological deficits compared to a single TBI, but the direct link
between the worsened outcome and elevated p-tau could not be established..

Neuroinvasive alphaviruses, including Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), cause
fatal encephalitis in humans. Unlike most arboviruses, aerosolized VEEV is infectious and
can result in enhanced disease severity. Combined with its capability to be grown to
high-titer, this makes VEEV a significant bioterrorist risk. Unfortunately, specific
therapies for neuroinvasive alphaviruses are limited. Type I interferons (IFNs) have potent
anti-viral activity and IFN signaling is associated with restricting infection and viral
clearance. Pretreatment with exogenous IFNα has been demonstrated to protect
against VEEV infection. However, the capacity of type-1 IFN treatment to limit VEEV
post-exposure has not been demonstrated. This study assessed neuroinvasion and IFN innate
immune responses during intranasal VEEV infection in mice. In this lethal model of
infection, VEEV arrives in the CNS by 24 hours post-infection. VEEV predominately spreads
along the olfactory tract, with GAP43+ immature olfactory sensory neurons within the
olfactory neuroepithelium (ONE) acting as an early site of infection. Despite rapid VEEV
neuroinvasion, host CNS type-1 IFN response is delayed compared to VEEV CNS entry,
representing a potential therapeutic window. This study evaluated the efficacy of
recombinant IFNα administered intranasally during VEEV infection. Importantly, this IFNα
treatment delayed onset of sequelae associated with VEEV encephalitis and extended survival
by several days. 2-photon imaging and immunohistochemistry demonstrated targeted protection
of both the ONE and olfactory tract within the brain during early infection. Additionally,
this study evaluated the CNS IFN response triggered by intranasal IFNα treatment to identify
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are associated with suppression of VEEV infection.
To-gether these data demonstrate the efficacy of intranasal delivery of IFNα on limiting
early VEEV CNS infection and represent a critical and promising first evaluation of such a
treatment strategy for human alphavirus infection..

A depressive disorder is among the most common psychiatric diseases and is expected to
become the second most common form of psychiatric illness by the year 2020 and affects
around 350 million people worldwide. Usually, existing antidepressant drugs used for
neurological disorders have several side effects. Fluoxetine is a second-generation
antidepressant drug and the administration of fluo-xetine (SSRI) has been shown to suppress
the growth of glioblastoma cells and expression of BDNF, which resulted in the enhancement
of long-term effects on the brain. As an outcome of this, there is growing consideration of
workers towards exploring relatively safer, efficient, and more cost-effective
antidepressant molecules isolated from plant extracts. In the current study, we have
investigated the antidepressant, neuroprotective and antioxidant effects of garlic extract
against reserpine induced depression in the experimental rat model. Animals were divided
into four different groups: (1) control, (2) reserpine, (3) reserpine with garlic extract,
and (4) reserpine with fluoxetine. The forced swimming test was used to evaluate the
anti-depressant activity of garlic extract and fluoxetine. The superoxide dismutase,
glutathione transferase, catalase, and some other metabolic enzyme levels (antioxidant
enzymes) were significantly decreased in the depressed rat brain. The levels of serotonin
and acetylcholinesterase activity were also altered due to reserpine; fluo-xetine and garlic
extract treatment, which suggested the alteration in biosynthesis and degradation of
serotonin taking place in the rat brain and were acquired by using Confocal micro Raman
spectrometer equipped with a BX43 microscope excited by 785 nm laser source together with
10x eyepiece. The obtained spectral features have been pre-processed and correlated with
biochemicals present in the cerebellum, cerebrum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and neocortex
and we found significant alterations, absence, and presence of different biochemicals in our
respective treatments. The study showed the significant neuroprotective and antidepressant
activity of garlic extract against reserpine induced depression..

Human brain imaging studies show that depression alters structural and functional
connectivity in brain circuits governing cognition and emotions. Consistent with this, the
unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS), a mouse model of depression, causes dendritic
spine and dendrite arbor retraction in principal neurons together with disruption in
Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons in cortico-limbic regions involved in the
control of mood. Based on data showing that the plant stress hormone - methyl jasmonate (MJ)
rescues the UCMS-induced depressive behavioral phenotype, here we examine whether the
compound also prevents neuronal connectivity defects in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), CA1
hippocampus subfield (CA1), and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC). Male C57BL/6 mice were
injected with MJ (50 mg/kg) or saline (SAL) before each of the two daily exposure to
unpredictable mild stressors administered over ten days. On day 11, mice were sacrificed for
Golgi-staining and immuno-histochemistry analyses. Results showed that mice exposed to UCMS
exhibited a massive reduction in spine density and dendritic arbor extension and fewer
PV+ cells in the three regions examined. MJ treatment alleviated structural
alterations in all regions but more in PFC than in BLA and CA1. The treatment also reduced
PV+ cell loss in all regions but more in BLA and CA1 than in PFC, where those cells were
mainly disrupted by UCMS exposure. Thus, in parallel with the alleviation of behavioral
markers of depression, MJ preserves neurons' morphological integrity and rescues the PV+
regulated excitatory/inhibitory balance in the mood circuitry. The global reinstatement of
physiological levels of neuronal connectivity and activity supports the MJ's relevance to
treating depressive subtypes associated with a parallel collapse of dendrite morphology and
PV+ cells at multiple brain sites..

Progesterone is a multifaceted hormone and neurosteroid found in both males and females.
During aging, serum levels of progesterone decline. The neuroprotective role of progesterone
is documented in many studies and includes reduction in traumatic-brain-injury-induced
behavioral deficits and associated increases in antioxidant catalase activity. Although the
cognitive-enhancing effects of progesterone are well documented, less is known about its
effects on age-related cognitive impairment. Our hypothesis was that exogenous
administration of progesterone would reduce age-related deficits in cognition and LTP in
male mice. To test this, we used groups of young (4-month-old) and aged (24-26-month-old)
male C57BL/6 mice. Daily subcutaneous injections of progesterone (5 mg/ kg) or equivalent
volumes (200 µl) of vehicle (30% 2-hydroxy beta-cyclodextrine) were administered to cohorts
from each group for 21 consecutive days. Cognitive functioning was assessed during the
21-days treatment interval using a water-T-maze reversal task. Mice had to locate a hidden
platform in one of two arms of the maze, in which the location was switched once the mouse
achieved an 80% success rate. At the end of the 21-day treatment period, long-term
potentiation (LTP) was recorded in the dentate gyrus (DG) following theta-burst stimulation
of the medial perforant path. Results revealed that aged, vehicle-treated mice attained
fewer reversals and required more days to complete each reversal than young vehicle-treated
mice. The LTP was also reduced in these aged mice. Treatment of progesterone improved the
performance of aged mice, resulting in an increase in number of reversals attained and
requiring fewer days to complete each reversal. LTP was also improved and was closer to that
observed in young, vehicle-treated mice. No significant changes were observed in young mice
receiving progesterone treatments. Our results indicate that progesterone treatment
(5 mg/kg/day, s.c. for 21 consecutive days) attenuates age-related cognitive impairment and
enhances neuronal plasticity relative to aged, vehicle-treated controls. This work

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating, neuroinflammatory and demyelinating disease
characterized by sensory changes, visual impairment, motor dysfunction leading to
irreversible disability. We investigated the role and contribution of A1 and A2A adenosine
receptors (ARs) in oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC), oligo-dendrocyte (OL) and myelin
regulation in cuprizone model of MS. Multiple sclerosis was induced in wild type C57BL/6
mice (WT) or C57BL/6 mice with global deletion of A1 adenosine receptor (A1 AR-/-) or A2A AR
(A2A AR-/-), by feeding them 0.2% cuprizone diet (CuD) for four weeks. Luxol fast blue,
Nissl, immunofluo-rescence staining, Western blotting, and several behavioral tests were
performed to evaluate demyelination/remyelination..

At three weeks post CuD, A1 AR-/- mice began to show signs of lethargy, weight loss, and
shivered vigorously. The corpus callosum, hippocampus of A1 AR-/- mice was completely
demyelinated. This contrasted with A2A AR-/- mice that had a significant increase in myelin
or hypermyelination, whereas WT mice on CuD had inter-mediate myelin quantity. Memory and
olfactory sensitivity were also impaired in A1 AR-/- mice with signs of anxiety.
Immunofluo-rescence staining with GFAP, IBA1 revealed astrogliosis in the AR knock out mice.
Western blot assay quantification of MOG revealed a significant decrease in A1 AR-/- but an
increase in A2A AR-/- mice. NeuN and MBP immunofluorescence staining also followed similar
trend. However, olig2 was upregulated and downregulated in A1 AR-/- and A2A AR-/-, mice
respectively. Using TUNEL staining, we verified that knocking out the A1 AR caused a 30-40
fold increase of apoptotic cells in different brain regions. Furthermore, WT mice on
cuprizone diet showed significant decrease in numbers of A1 AR in the brain..

These results indicate that A1 and A2A ARs are involved in OPC/OL functions and suggest
their opposing roles in myelin, OPC and OL regulation. We conclude that the
neuropathological findings in multiple sclerosis may be connected to the depletion of A1
adenosine receptors..

Demyelination occurs in a large variety of central nervous system (CNS) insults,
pathologies, and neurodegenerative diseases, including Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Parenchymal
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) located throughout the CNS participate in endogenous
remyelination of white matter lesions, migrating to the injury site and maturing into
myelinating oligodendrocytes, albeit at low levels. An additional source of OPCs following
CNS injury is neural stem cell (NSC)-derived OPCs generated in the subventricular zone (SVZ)
of the lateral ventricles. Therefore, promoting increased levels of NSC gliogenesis is a
promising therapeutic strategy for demyelinating disorders like MS. We previously identified
the Endothelin-1 (ET-1) signaling pathway as a novel regulator of NSC and OPC proliferation
during early postnatal development (Adams et al. 2020). Therefore, we asked whether ET-1
also regulates stem and progenitor cells in the adult SVZ, both during homeostasis and after
demyelinating injury. We found that the majority of NSC populations in the adult mouse SVZ
express the ET-1 receptor, Ednrb. Ablation of Ednrb from NSCs reduced both the number of
activated and quiescent NSCs, indicating that ET-1 signaling is required for maintenance of
NSCs in the adult mouse. Following focal demyelination of the corpus callosum, SVZ NSCs
upregulated expression of ET-1. Ablation of ET-1 reduced the percentages of proliferating
NSCs and proliferating OPCs in the SVZ, suggesting that ET-1 plays a critical role in the
SVZ proliferative response to injury. RNAseq of cultured primary NSCs and OPCs treated with
ET-1 identified genes involved in stem cell maintenance, including Notch signaling, and OPC
migration. Lastly, we confirmed that ET-1 and EDNRB expression are conserved in the adult
human SVZ, indicating that this pathway may be a potential target for promoting SVZ-mediated
cellular repair..

Postmortem studies of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients demonstrate decreased mitochondrial
activity in addition to inflammation throughout the central nervous system. Gait
abnormalities in MS patients have been linked to Purkinje cell (PC) demyelination, blebbing
axons, and atrophy of dendrites in the cerebellum. Similar changes in PCs are also observed
in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In addition, axonal degeneration is
linked to loss of metabolic support and demyelination. We hypothesize that mitochondrial
dysfunction causes axonal degeneration in the context of inflammatory degeneration. To test
this hypothesis, cerebellar pathology was investigated longitudinally in EAE disease course
from peak disease (day 21) to late disease (day 90). Behavior (walking gait test and
rotarod), pathology (immunohistochemistry and Western blot), and mitochondrial function
(Seahorse XFp Mito Stress Test) were assessed. From peak disease to late disease, the
average EAE clinical score was 2.5. Behavioral tests showed that EAE mice had decreased time
on the rotarod and decreased stride length compared to normal. Similarly, increased
inflammation and decreased myelination were observed at all timepoints. Mitochondria
electron transport chain levels showed no change at peak disease, but chronic EAE showed
decreased COXIV, ATP Synthase, mito-chondria fusion (Mfn2), and increased mitochondrial
fission (Drp1). Mitochondria dysfunction was evident with decreased basal respiration
beginning at peak disease and lasting through chronic disease. These data demonstrate that
mitochondria dysfunction is evident by peak disease following irreversible axon damage.
Future studies will determine whether early treatment with an estrogen receptor beta ligand
before axon damage occurs can alleviate mito-chondria dysfunction and slow neurodegeneration
in EAE..

Objective: To characterize extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by B cells
from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients..

Background: In MS, B cells mediate pathogenesis by mechanisms separate from
immunoglobulin (Ig) production. Supernatants (Sup) from B cell cultures from 53 MS patients
but only 1 of 53 matched controls kill cultured rat oligodendroglia (OL) (Lisak et al. 2012,
2017, unpublished). Killing does not require complement, and does not correlate with Sup
levels of IgG, IgM or cytokines tested. OL death is mediated by factors in EVs (Benjamins et
al. 2019)..

Methods: B cells were cultured in EV-depleted serum-free medium. EVs were
prepared from Sup by filtration and ultracentrifugation. Sup or EVs were diluted 1:4 with OL
culture medium and tested for OL toxicity..

Results: Analysis of EV particle size showed a major peak between 70-90 nm,
consistent with the size of exosomes. Proteomics analysis of MS and control EVs showed
characteristic exosomal markers and B cell proteins. We developed methods for proteomic
analysis of the low amounts of protein in the isolated EVs, based on TMT multi-plexing, and
a strategy for RNASeq, lipidomic and integrated bio-informatic analyses. Studies in progress
will give sample-size estimates based on analysis of variability for detection of
significant differences between MS and control..

Conclusions: Both particle sizing and proteomics indicate that EVs released by
MS and control B cells consist primarily of particles with the properties of exosomes. A
multi-omics approach may allow identification of candidates responsible for OL toxicity in
exosome-enriched fractions from MS B cells..

Mature mammalian CNS neurons do not regenerate or recover following injuries, ischemic
events or neurodegenerative disease. It is confirmed that there are different transcription
factors that have been recently linked to axonal growth and survival, changes in regulation
of these transcription factors with aging will eventually affect the gene expression levels
of many other genes including those involved in axonal regeneration. It has been previously
shown that there is a robust collateral sprouting response within the distant terminal field
of magnocellular neurons, the neurohypophysis, arising from the contralateral non-injured
supraoptic neurons in response to unilateral denervation of MCNs tracts, the response peaked
at age 35 days then it was followed by a complete loss of the regenerative capacity between
35 days and 125 days of age. Our aim is to compare the transcription profile between young
regenerating neurons and mature non-regenerating neurons and thier associated glia, the
pituicytes, in the neurohypophysis. To address these questions we will be using the
hypothalamic-neurohypophysis system as a model system; a unique CNS system with which we can
study the epigenetic changes that undelie the decline in neuronal plasticity in the context
of dynamic neuronal-glial interaction. RNA seq analysis and enrichement analysis would help
determnine which genes are up-regulated or down-regulated between the two age groups and how
these changes in gene expression can relate to age associated alterations in neuronal
survival and axonal outgrowth..

It is now well-known that astrocytes are active participants in the tripartite synapse.
However, today there is an opinion that synapse represents the tetrapartite structure, which
includes additionally the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is formed by glycoproteins and
proteoglycans, released by neurons and glial cells. ECM does not only affect the synapse
stability and function but the function of the glial cell as well. The aim was to study
diversity in the expression values (EVs) of ECM-associated molecules (ECM-AMs) in cultured
astrocytes and in vivo..

In the present study, I demonstrate heterogeneity in ECM-AMs EVs between astrocytes in vivo
obtained by immunomagnetic separation from P3 rats, and cultured astrocytes from the Bst,
Ctx and Hip. Transcriptomic data demonstrated the increase in EVs of ECM-AMs genes in
cultures. Studies of the ECM-AMs gene families showed EVs of most Col family were increased
in Bst, whereas in Hip EVs of the most genes were decreased in cultures. In all comparison
groups, EVs of Col1a1 and Col4a1 were increased. For Thbs family genes we found in the
cultures EVs were increased including Thbs1 and Thbs2. Itg family genes EVs showed up-and
downregulation in the same comparison group. Analysis of Lam family genes EVs revealed the
most Lam genes were upregulated in all groups, e.g. Lamc1 and Lamb2 were increased in all
groups. A similar tendency was found for Sdc genes EVs, Sdc1 and Sdc4 were upregulated in
cultures of Ctx and Hip, whereas Sdc1 was upregulated in the culture of Bst. Fn1, Spp1, CD44
were increased in all groups but TnN and Hmmr were increased in cultures of Bst and Ctx. In
contrast, Agrn and Reln were downregulated in cultures of Bst and Ctx, and Ctx and Hip,
respectively..

Altogether obtained data indicate the significant contribution of glial cells in releasing
of ECM-AMs and formation ECM in the brain, as well as on dramatic differences between
cultured astrocytes and cells in vivo..

MICRORNAS TARGETING NEURONAL NMDA RECEPTORS

N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated calcium channels, which play a
major role in synaptic plasticity. Dysregulation of NMDAR is associated with several
neuro-degenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. The NMDAR subunits
GluN2A/Grin2A and GluN2B/Grin2B have a developmentally
regu-lated expression profile (Cathala L et al., 2002, J.Neurosci.,20. p5899). We found that
Grin2B expression is highest in days in vitro 7-9 (DIV
7-9) in rat hippocampal primary neuronal cultures and declines thereafter.
Grin2A expression becomes significant by DIV 7-9 and the level is
maintained subsequently..

Drugs that target NMDAR have major side effects and hence alternate subtle strategies are
needed to indirectly target these receptors. The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in neurological
disorders is being widely explored (Wang W. et al, 2012, Learn. Mem.,19. p359). Our
objective is to understand the mechanism of action of some miRNAs involved in NMDAR-mediated
synaptic plasticity that are also differentially expressed in disease conditions. Some
miRNAs that are altered in schizophrenia, Huntington disease and autism were predicted to
interact with NMDAR subunits. Luciferase assays showed that miRNAs such as miR-223 and
miR-129 interacted with the subunits of NMDAR. Expression levels of the target proteins in
primary hippocampal neurons was downregulated after transfection of miRNA. To study
regulation by these miRNAs in vivo we have established the MK-801 model and
the MAM model of Schizophrenia. We have injected rats with MK-801 at post natal days 30-40
for five days followed by five day washout period. We injected MAM at gestational day 17 and
the pups were weaned at P30. The animals underwent different behavior tests such as open
field test, object recognition test and Morris water maze test. It was found that the
treated animals have major cognitive impairment. Expression of some of the miRNA/s and their
target proteins in these animals is under investigation. These studies may unravel novel
mechanisms, which can be of therapeutic potential..

CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS IN MOTOR CORTEX PERSIST IN VIVO BUT NOT EX VIVO

Many behaviors in animals, such as sleep and feeding, are often only performed at certain
times of day. However, even in the absence of a daily environmental cycle, this circadian
behavioral rhythmicity will persist, organized around the animal's internal representation
of time of day. In mammals, many cells maintain their own self-sustaining molecular core
clock, characterized by the daily rise and fall of certain circadian
proteins. The many cellular clocks of the body are entrained to the
earth's daily cycle by a hypothalamic brain region, the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN).
However, how this internal clock is translated from SCN rhythms to behavior is still
unexplored. Our project studies the mechanisms driving circadian rhythms in primary motor
cortex (M1), as it controls many voluntary motor behaviors separating the role of circadian
rhythms in cortical neurons and astrocytes. As a measure of molecular clock function, we
recorded the expression of the core clock protein PER2 using the bioluminescent reporter
luciferase fused to PER2 (PER2::LUC) recorded in vivo in anesthetized animals with a CCD
camera and ex vivo from cultured M1 slice, or per2 promoter expression in
either neurons or astrocytes in freely behaving mice using virally induced expression of the
fluorescent reporter per2-Venus, recorded directly from M1 using an optic
fiber. We found that, in intact animal cortical PER2 expression is rhythmic, peaking in the
middle of the light phase. per2 promoter expression is also rhythmic in
both neurons and astrocytes, but peaks during the dark phase. In ex vivo M1 slice, PER2
rhythmicity is lost upon excision but are restored with a single addition of glucocorticoid
agonist Dexamethasone (DEX) for up to 4 days. We concluded that the molecular clock in
Neocortex requires Glucocorticoid input to remain rhythmic..

EXAMINING BDNF/ASTROCYTIC TRKB.T1 SIGNALING AS A MECHANISM UNDERLYING PERISYNAPTIC
ASTROCYTE PROCESS RECRUITMENT

Astrocytes are a morphologically complex cell type and that have emerged as critical
players in both the development and physiology of the central nervous system (CNS). Their
morphological complexity allows astrocytes to dynamically interact with neuronal synapses,
where they establish and maintain synaptic connectivity by cradling synapses with peripheral
astrocyte processes (PAPs). Astrocyte morphological maturation and the formation of PAPs
occurs concurrently with synapse development. However, the signaling mechanisms that draw a
PAP to “cradle” the synapse are not understood. In neurons, brain derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) promotes neuronal growth, survival, and synaptic refinement. RNA sequencing
data from isolated astrocytes has demonstrated that astro-cytes express high levels of the
BDNF receptor, TrkB. Specifically, they predominantly express a truncated form of TrkB,
TrkB.T1. Our recent work suggests that BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling in astrocytes is an important
signaling mechanism underlying astrocyte morphogenesis. Here, we examine if BDNF/TrkB.T1
signaling in astrocytes mediates the arrival of PAPs to developing synapses. In
vitro co-cultures of wild type neurons with TrkB.T1 deficient astro-cytes
demonstrates that these morphologically immature astrocytes do not support normal
synaptogenesis and function. In vivo, using TrkB.T1 knockout mice,
immunohistochemistry and analysis of structurally formed synapses via pre-and post-synaptic
(VGluT1/ PSD95) co-localization suggests this receptor may mediate normal synapse formation.
We further aim to manipulate the whisker barrel cortex to examine the arrival of PAPs to a
synapse and the relevance of BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling in this astrocyte experience-dependent
structural plasticity. Alterations in synaptic function and development have been implicated
in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, but the majority of the research has only focused
on the neuronal players. This work will advance the understanding of the role of astrocytes
in synaptic development and offer new therapeutic targets where synapse development is
implicated..

UPREGULATION OF VOLTAGE-GATED CALCIUM CHANNEL SUBUNIT Α2Δ1 MEDIATES CHRONIC
STRESS-INDUCED ENHANCEMENT OF NMDA RECEPTOR ACTIVITY
.

Chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) augments NMDA receptor activity in
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus
(PVN). However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Recent studies have shown that NMDA
receptor activity is regulated by voltage-gated Ca++ channel (VGCC) subunit α2δ1.
In this study, we tested a hypothesis that chronic stress increases NMDA receptor activity
through upregulation of α2δ1 subunit. Rat hypothalamic CRH neurons were identified by
specific expression of GFP driven by CRH premotor. CUS increased α2δ1 protein expression
level in the PVN tissue. Immuno-staining revealed that α2δ1 was distributed on hypothalamic
CRH neurons. In brain slice preparation, NMDA receptor blocker AP5 decreased the firing
activity of PVN-CRH neurons in CUS rats while had no effect on firing activity in
un-stressed rats. However, disruption of α2δ1 binding with NMDA receptor with gabapentin
eliminated inhibitory effect of AP5 on firing activity of PVN-CRH neurons in CUS rats.
Furthermore, CUS increased NMDA currents elicited by puff application of NMDA onto PVN-CRH
neurons. Gabapentin normalized the increase in NMDA currents in CUS rats. Microinfusion of
either gabapentin or AP5 into the PVN through an implanted cannula targeting the PVN
normalized high CORT levels in CUS rats. Infusion of gabapentin plus AP5 into the PVN did
not induce further decreased in CORT levels in CUS rats. Taken together, these data suggest
that chronic unpredictable stress increases NMDA receptor activity through upregulation of
α2δ1 subunit. Disruption of NMDA receptor binding with α2δ1 normalize hyperactivity of
PVN-CRH neurons and HPA axis..

Current models used to study the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) are
laborious and time-consuming. This study characterized the impact of a 14-day combined
stress model (CS; corticosterone injection (40mg/kg, s.c.) and chronic immobilization
stress) in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. Depressive-like behaviors and cognitive deficits
were assessed in the Sucrose preference and Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests, respectively.
Subsequently, effects of the stress model on the serotonergic system (measured by examining
the concentration of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and expressions of the serotonin
transporter (5-HTT) and serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A)) were determined in the hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex (PFC), regions implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD. Findings show
that the CS group expressed increases in time to reach the MWM platform, PFC 5-HT1A, and
hippocampal 5- HT1A and AChE, but reductions in sucrose preference ratio, time in MWM target
quadrant, and hippocampal 5-HTT compared to their control group. Compared to the 28 days of
the corticosterone-only group, PFC 5-HT1A was reduced, while 5-HTT was higher in the CS
group. Taken together, our CS model induced depressive-like behavior with early cognitive
deficits in rats, mainly affecting the hippocampus. The CS model can be useful in
investigating new and comprehensive treatment strategies for MDD..

The gap junction nexus is a supramolecular structure at which connexin-based gap junction
channels cluster to join adjacent cellular compartments. Gap junctions are prominent in the
brain and act as adhesions, serve as platforms that modulate cell morphology, and mediate
intercellular communication. Gap junctions in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are required
for normal brain function. Fluorescent protein tags and live-cell microscopy have been
important approaches in gap junction research. These tools have synergized with
electrophysiology techniques to greatly enhance our understanding mechanisms by which gap
junctions contribute to brain health and cognition. A major gap junction isoform expressed
in astrocytes is connexin 43 (Cx43). Cx43 has been studied extensively using fluorescent
protein tags but tagging Cx43 with peptide additions generates problematic collateral
effects by either completely eliminating channel function (amino-terminal tag) or by
preventing protein binding of important regulators of channel function and gap junction
structure (carboxyl-terminal tag). We present new tagging strategies that allow channel
function while maintaining many of the protein interactions with the carboxyl-terminus of
Cx43. We present insights gained new microscopy and image analysis techniques. We use
virtual reality and spatial computing approaches to examine interactions between the gap
junction nexus and the other organelles (e.g. mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum).
Finally, we will present results of computational simulations that suggest proximity to
other organelles and nexus structural stability may modulate intercellular calcium signaling
through gap junctions..

The omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is enriched in the central nervous
system and thought to protect against neuro-logical dysfunction. While dietary DHA
supplementation increases DHA levels in peripheral tissues, it often fails to increase brain
DHA levels. The indirect relationship between dietary-DHA and brain-DHA highlights the
existence of unique mechanisms that allow DHA to be enriched in the brain. To this end, our
lab recently discovered an enzyme that is required for neural brain DHA enrichment,
long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 6 (Acsl6), which performs the initial reaction required for
cellular fatty acid metabolism. By producing an Acsl6 deficient mouse (Acsl6−/-
), we now have a model with large and specific reductions (35-72%) in brain DHA-containing
phospho-lipids. In situ hybridization data demonstrates that Acsl6 is expressed in neurons
throughout the brain and MALDI lipid imaging demonstrates that Acsl6−/- brains
have reductions in DHA-containing phos-pholipids across the entire brain, an effect that is
specific to Acsl6 expression in neurons but not astrocytes. Interestingly, the composition
of compensatory replacement lipids was not consistent across the entire brain but was rather
differential in a regionally specific manner. The high levels of DHA-containing
phospholipids in the cerebellum are largely replaced by arachidonic acid-containing
phos-pholipids in the absence of Acsl6, along with evidence of age-related cerebellar
astrogliosis, microglia activation, and induction of inflammation-related genes.
Behaviorally, Acsl6-/- mice present with disruptions in motor function concomitant to
deregulated neurotrans-mitter homeostasis. Our findings suggest that Acsl6 has unique roles
for regulating brain lipid metabolism and that Acsl6-mediated DHA deficiency results in
motor dysfunction and aging-induced neuro-pathology..

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with increased depression. Dietary fatty
acids can be converted by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450s) into neuroprotective epoxides;
however their beneficial effects are limited when metabolized by soluble epoxide hydrolase
(sEH) into inactive or cytotoxic diols. We found higher serum diol concentrations in T2DM
patients with depression, and the linoleic acid-derived 12,13 diol/epoxide ratio, a proxy
measure of sEH flux, was associated with depression severity. Relevant mechanisms are not
fully understood; however, sEH has been related to brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
in animals. Here, we examine the serum 12,13 diol/epoxide ratio and BDNF concentrations in
T2DM patients with and without depression. Individuals with T2DM (glycosylated hemoglobin
[HbA1c] above 6.4 %, impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance) were recruited
and diagnosed with current depression using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5,
Research Version. Unesterified oxylipins were extracted from fasting serum through solid
phase extraction and quantified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry. Serum BDNF was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among 89
participants (mean age 62.6 ±9.7, 56 % women, mean HbA1c 7.4 ±1.2%), 24% were depressed (8
men, 13 women). In an analysis of covariance including age, sex, body mass index, glycemic
control (HbA1c), depression, and antidepressant use, the 12,13 diol/epoxide ratio was
associated with BDNF (F=2.674, p=0.012) but this relationship was specific to those without
depression (depression×12,13 ratio interaction F=4.586, p=0.035). These findings suggest a
relationship between sEH activity and circulating BDNF concentrations, that was disrupted in
depressed people with T2DM, which may help to understand pathophysiological changes in
depression..

REGULATION OF SODIUM-DEPENDENT GLUTAMATE UPTAKE BY PALMITOYLATION
.

.

Glutamate is the main excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter in the central nervous system,
it is required for different cognitive processes such as learning and memory, but if the
concentration of glutamate is not kept low, it would induce neuronal death by
excitotoxicity. Sodium-dependent glutamate uptake is essential to regulate glutamate
concentration. The astroglial glutamate transporters glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and
glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) mediate the majority of forebrain and cerebellum
glutamate uptake, respectively. These transporters are regulated by both transcriptional and
post-translational processes. There is evidence that glutamate uptake is regulated in the
plasma membrane (Murohy-Royal et al 2015). There is evidence that GLT-1 glutamate uptake is
regulated by palmitoylation (Huang et al, 2010). The goal of this study was to explore this
regulation. Palmitoylation is generally thought to be a reversible post-translational
modification that regulates the activity of several different membrane proteins. We used
crude synaptosomes prepared from cortex or cerebellum to determine if an inhibitor of
palymitolylation (2-bromopalmitate, 2-BP) affects Na+-dependent glutamate uptake.
As was reported earlier, we found that 2-BP (50 µM) inhibited uptake after 30min to 63±4% of
control (N=14, p<0.001) in cortical synaptosomes. Unlike that found earlier, we also
found that 2-BP reduced cerebellar uptake to 63±9% of control (N=8, p<0.005), but the
methods for uptake were somewhat different. These effects were concentration-dependent
(n=4). The effect of 2- BP was blocked by an inhibitor (PalmB) of depalmitotoylating enzymes
(APT1 &2). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that both GLT-1 and GLAST
activity are dependent upon palmito-ylation. We also found that 2-BP has an effect on
cortical glutamate uptake even when the synaptosomes are not pre-incubated (to 74±7% of
control, n=7, p <0.05), consistent with the notion that there is a pool of
non-palmitoylated GLT-1 in vivo. Studies are underway to determine if these effects are
associated with changes in palmito-ylated GLT-1 and GLAST..

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a rare, genetic disease in which increased very
long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs, C22-C26) cause CNS demyelination and axonal degeneration,
leading to severe neurological deficits. The elevation in VLFCAs is caused by mutations in
ABCD1, which encodes a peroxisomal transporter responsible for the uptake
of VLCFAs for degradation. Sobetirome, a potent thyroid hormone agonist, has been shown to
lower VLCFA levels in the periphery and CNS of Abcd1 knockout (KO) mice. In
this study, we evaluated two pharmacological strategies for enhancing the effects of
thyromimetics. First, we tested a CNS-selective prodrug of sobetirome, which significantly
lowered total C26:0/C22:0 and C26:0-lysophosphatidylcholine in the brain and spinal cord of
Abcd1 KO mice. We also demonstrated that the pro-drug was better
tolerated than the parent drug due to lower peripheral exposure. Second, we co-administered
thyroid hormone with sobetirome to correct for thyromimetic-induced suppression of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Addition of thyroid hormone enhanced VLCFA lowering in
the periphery compared to sobetirome alone, but did not produce greater lowering in the CNS.
This result suggested that the extent of lowering in the CNS was limited by a mechanistic
threshold related to slow turnover kinetics. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that
CNS-penetrating thyromimetics improve dosing tolerance and correct the lipid abnormality
associated with X-ALD in peripheral organs, brain, and spinal cord..

INTRODUCTION Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with
neuroendocrine dysfunction which may contribute to comorbid stress-sensitive disorders. The
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and -gonadal (HPG) axes are perturbed in up to 50% of
HIV patients, but the mechanisms are not known, but we find that transgenic expression of
Tat protein recapitulates the clinical phenotype in male mice..

PURPOSE We hypothesized that HPA and/or HPG dysregulation contributes to
Tat-mediated interactions with oxycodone, a clinically-used opioid often prescribed to HIV
patients..

METHODS Mice that expressed the Tat1-86 protein [Tat(+) mice] or
their control counterparts that did not [Tat(-) control mice] were exposed to forced swim
stress (or not) and behaviorally-assessed for motor behavior in the open field task. Mice
werepretreated with vehicle, RU-486, or antalarmin to block glucocorticoid receptors (GR) or
CRF receptors (CRF-R), respectively and some mice were ovariectomized. Circulating
corticosterone was assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay..

RESULTS In transgenic female mice, HIV Tat elevated corticosterone levels
recapitulating the clinical HIV phenotype. We have found males to additionally express
adrenal insufficiency in response to Tat exposure, however, this was not observed in
females. When challenged with oxycodone, Tat-exposed females demonstrated a potentiated
psychomotor response that was not attenuated by GR or CRF-R inhibition. However,
ovariectomizing females demonstrated elevated hypothalamic allopregnanolone levels
concurrent with significant attenuation of the psychomotor response revealing gonadal
hormones for Tat-mediated potentiation of oxycodone. Irrespective of genotype, either
diestrous cycle phase or exposure to oxycodone showed a significant increase in
hypo-thalamic allopregnanolone in non-stressed or stressed paradigm which may indicate a
central adaptive response to stress..

CONCLUSIONS Together, these effects support the notion that Tat exposure
dysregulates the HPA and HPG axes, potentially raising vulnerability to stress-related
substance use disorders in females. HPG activation may be necessary for the combined
oxycodone-Tat interaction indicating the importance of maintained HPG feedback in this
vulnerable population..

The endogenous opioid peptide systems are critical for analgesia, reward processing, and
negative affect, however research on their in vivo function in modulation
of these behaviors has been challenging due to an inability to reliably detect dynamic
changes in opioid peptides. There is little to no data directly measuring dynamic in
vivo changes of endogenous opioids, in particular dynorphin. The ability to
correlate changes in brain neuropeptide levels during circuit or behavioral manipulations
will exponentially evolve our understanding of brain processing. Thus, our work aims to
develop innovative approaches for rapid and sensitive detection of opioid peptide release
in vivo. We developed microimmunoelectrodes (MIEs) for electro-chemical
detection of opioid peptides. Because all opioid peptides contain an electroactive tyrosine
residue as part of their N-terminus sequence, square-wave voltammetry can be used to measure
their presence. Briefly, a voltage is applied to the electrode to cause oxidation of the
tyrosine residue, which is detected as current. To provide specificity to these voltammetric
measurements, the carbon fiber surface of the MIE is coated with antibody selective to the
opioid peptide of interest and any remaining binding sites are blocked with bovine serum
albumin. To test the sensitivity of the MIEs, electrodes are immersed in solutions
containing different concentrations of opioid peptides, and oxidative current is measured.
We show that dynorphin antibody-coated electrodes are sensitive to increasing concentrations
of dynorphin in the fmol range. To confirm specificity, oxidative current is also measured
to tyrosine and other opioid peptides. The dynorphin antibody-coated MIEs are sensitive to
metenkephalin and detect a small oxidative current to tyrosine, and we are working to
minimize these non-specific electrochemical signals. Future work aims to demonstrate the
utility of these MIEs both in vitro via brain slice preparation and
in vivo for real-time, rapid detection of endogenous opioid peptide
release in awake and behaving animals..

Opioids are the primary treatment to relieve pain, however, their chronic use can lead to
severe addiction. The withdrawal syndrome associated with abstinence from opioids often
results in relapse, sometimes fatal and prevents long-term abstinence. Studies have shown
that increased expression of dynorphin mRNA, the endogenous kappa opioid receptor ligand,
increases during withdrawal in the nucleus accumbens. However, there is no reliable method
to directly measure in vivo changes in opioid peptides. We describe a
method coupling microdialysis and nano-liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry to detect
endogenous opioid peptides in vivo. The in vivo resolution
not only advances our ability to reliably measure opioid peptides, but also allows us to
correlate dynamic changes with behavioral outputs. We hypothesize that the kappa opioid
system modulates the somatic and affective components of withdrawal leading to relapse. We
use osmotic mini-pumps to establish a fentanyl dependent mouse model, and measure somatic
and anxiety-like symptoms during withdrawal. During the 14 day infusion, mice are monitored
for analgesic behavior, using the hot and cold plate tests, and for anxiety behavior using
the Open Field Test(OFT), and Elevator Plus Maze(EPM). Additionally, we use DeepLabCut for
pose estimation to assess the somatic signs of withdrawal. On day 14 of infusion, mice are
implanted with a microdialysis probe in the nucleus accumbens to allow for continuous sample
collection. We demonstrate that fentanyl is analgesic at one week, and that this effect is
not reversible by naloxone at withdrawal. We do not detect anxiety behavior in OFT during
fentanyl infusion, however, naloxone alone significantly decreases open-arm time in EPM.
Additionally, the mice undergoing precipitated withdrawal show significantly greater somatic
signs of withdrawal specifically grooming and foraging. Finally, we successfully detected
met-enkephalin and leu-enkephalin in vivo during withdrawal. Our findings
introduce a novel method of monitoring opioid peptide levels while simultaneously assessing
withdrawal behaviors..

Regulation of cellular energy metabolism is important to the central nervous system (CNS),
where energy is in high demand. Alcohol in-toxication is a harmful condition induced by
excessive consumption of alcohol. Alcohol diffuses through most cell membranes and can be
metabolized by most tissues. The brain, particularly the cerebral cortex, is vulnerable to
alcohol intoxication. Alcohol intoxication causes impairment of motor function. Nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is known as an important co-enzyme for cellular
energy metabolism and NAD+ is consumed during alcohol metabolism. Here we treated
primary cortical neurons with various concentrations of alcohol, and studied cellular
bioenergetic stress during alcohol intoxication using various assays. We found that alcohol
caused an increase in neuronal injury and reductions of NAD+, NADH, and ATP
levels in a dose dependent manner. We also found that alcohol intoxication decreased
mitochondrial membrane potential and increased oxidative stress. Moreover, alcohol
in-toxication impaired both mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic function and affected
glycolysis less than mitochondrial respiration under mitochondrial stress. Finally,
supplement of NAD+ ameliorated ATP reduction and neuronal death, and improved
mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic function after alcohol intoxication. The current
study provides new insights into neuronal bioenergetics after alcohol intoxication, and
repletion of NAD+ and enhancing NAD+ biosynthesis might be a potential
therapeutic strategy for reducing neuronal degeneration and ameliorating motor impairment
caused by alcohol intoxication..

ASTROCYTES

Macroautophagy dysregulation is implicated in multiple neuro-logical disorders, such as
Parkinson's disease. While autophagy pathways are heavily researched in heterologous cells
and neurons, regulation of autophagy in the astrocyte, the most abundant cell type in the
mammalian brain, is less well understood. Missense mutations in the SYNJ1 gene encoding
Synaptojanin1 (Synj1), a neuron-enriched lipid phosphatase, have been linked to Parkinsonism
with seizures. Our previous study showed that the Synj1 haploinsufficient (Synj1+/-) mouse
exhibits age-dependent autophagy impairment in multiple brain regions. Here, we used
cultured astrocytes from Synj1-deficient mice to investigate its role in astrocyte
autophagy. We report Synj1 is expressed in low levels in astrocytes and represses basal
autophagosome formation. We demonstrate using cellular imaging that Synj1-deficient
astrocytes exhibit hyperactive auto-phagosome formation, represented by an increase in the
size and the number of GFP-LC3 structures. Interestingly, Synj1 deficiency is also
associated with an impairment in stress-induced autophagy clearance. We show, for the first
time, that the Parkinsonism-associated R839C mutation impacts autophagy in astrocytes. The
impact of this mutation on Synj1's phosphatase function resulted in elevated basal
autophagosome formation that mimics Synj1 deletion. We found that the membrane expression of
the astrocyte-specific glucose transporter GluT-1 was reduced in Synj1-deficient astrocytes.
Consistently, AMPK activity was elevated, suggesting altered glucose sensing in
Synj1-deficient astrocytes. Expressing exogenous GluT-1 in Synj1-deficient astrocytes
reversed the autophagy impairment, supporting a role for Synj1 in regulating astrocyte
auto-phagy via disrupting glucose-sensing pathways. Thus, our work suggests a novel
mechanism for Synj1-related Parkinsonism involving astrocyte dysfunction..

FINE STRUCTURE OF THE MYELIN AT AXON INITIAL SEGMENT IN SPINAL CORD
.

Miki Furusho, Mark Terasaki.


Univ. Connecticut Health, Cell Biology, Farmington, USA
.

The neuronal action potential initiates at the axon initial segment (AIS) and is rapidly
and efficiently propagated along the myelinated axon by the Nodes of Ranvier. The AIS and
Node of Ranvier have a similar high density of channels. While the nodes are specialized for
reliable propagation, the AIS is involved in the initiation, and the neuron may have the
capability to modify the properties of the AIS in order to fine-tune its excitation..

The fine structure of the myelin at the Node of Ranvier is well characterized but that of
the myelin at the AIS is not. This is because it is difficult to locate the AIS of neurons
by conventional EM techniques. We used serial sections from an ATUM tape collector to
inspect by electron microscopy about 1000 images of 300um x 250um areas of the cervical
spinal cord and found 9 AIS..

We compared these AIS with 8 Nodes of Ranvier which had similar axon diameters. We found
three major differences. 1) There were two types of myelin structures at the AIS. One was
similar to myelin at the Node of Ranvier. The other type had more than one compact myelin
around the axon and myelin loops of outside compact myelin contact with the inside myelin
sheath. 2) There were mitochondria in the loop at both Node of Ranvier and AIS..

Whereas at the AIS, the average number of mitochondria in the loop was 18.2±2.7, at the
Node of Ranvier it was 11.2±2.2. 3) At the Node of Ranvier, there were 1-2 endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) tubules in each myelin loop. At the AIS, however, most of the myelin loops
contained 2-5 ER tubules..

It seems likely that the paranode at the AIS may have an effect on the initiation of action
potentials. Possibly, the structural differences from the Nodes of Ranvier are reflective of
the plasticity of this para-node..

Dysregulation of ceramide and sphingomyelin levels have been suggested to contribute to the
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ceramide transfer proteins (CERTs) are ceramide
carriers which are crucial for ceramide and sphingomyelin balance in cells. Extracellular
forms of CERTs co-localize with amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in AD brains. To date, the
significance of these observations for the pathophysiology of AD remains uncertain. A
plasmid expressing CERTL, the long isoform of CERTs, and the recombinant
CERTL protein were used to study the interaction of CERTL with
amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ in vitro. CERTL was
overexpressed in neurons by adeno associated virus (AAV) in a mouse model of familial AD
(5xFAD). Twelve weeks after transduction, brains were investigated for sphingolipid levels
by mass spectrometry, plaques and neuroinflammation by immuno-histochemistry, gene
expression and/or immunoassay. We report that CERTL, binds to APP, modifies Aβ
aggregation and reduces Aβ neurotoxicity in vitro. Furthermore, we show
that intracortical injection of AAV, mediating the expression of CERTL, decreases
levels of ceramide d18:1/16:0, Aβ formation and microglia pro-inflammatory phenotype in the
cortex of 5xFAD. Our results demonstrate a crucial role of CERTL in regulating
ceramide levels, amyloid plaque formation and neuroinflammation..

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease characterized by disrupted metabolism and high glucose
levels, which complications include cognitive disfunction. In diabetic patients, functional
and structural abnormalities have been shown by brain magnetic resonance imaging.
Additionally, several studies have implied free radicals (FR) in the cognitive loss caused
by DM, since high consumption of O2 and glucose in the CNS produces FR, which in turn, makes
CNS vulnerable to the harmful effects of the reactive oxygen species. Various mechanisms of
cognitive damage induced by hyperglycemia have been proposed. There is a wide discrepancy in
the reported results, mainly because of methodological differences among studies (e.g., the
hyperglycemic model, the time-lapse between hyper-glycemia induction, and the learning
paradigms). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of sub-chronic hyperglycemia
on spatial memory paradigms and its correlation with oxidative stress markers. CD-1 mice
were administered with STZ and fifteen days later, learning and memory capabilities were
evaluated the in two explicit memory tasks: 1) eight-arm radial maze, or 2) buried food
location test. The increase of oxidative stress was evaluated by the lipoperoxidation and
antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the hippocampus. Our
results showed that DM is associated with increase lipid peroxidation and a significant
decrease of antioxidant activity of enzymes. We conclude that hyper-glycemia induces FR, due
to a decline of antioxidant enzymatic activity in the hippocampus, this may contribute to
the cognitive impairment in diabetic mice. However, biochemical and molecular studies are
needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these findings..

Lanthionine ketimine (LK) is a natural amino acid metabolite found at low concentrations in
mammalian brain tissue. LK, and its synthetic ethyl ester derivative, LKE, have potent
neuroprotective, neurotrophic and anti-neuroinflammatory properties and have been shown to
increase autophagy in neurons and glia. LKE shows benefits in diverse preclinical models of
Alzheimer's disease, amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), glioma, multiple sclerosis,
traumatic brain injury and stroke. Using LK and LKE as lead compounds, we have recently
synthesized a series of 17 phosphonate or non-phos-phonate LK analogues. The synthesis
incorporates multiple reactions in “one-pot.” The structures were confirmed by
1H, 13C and 31P NMR and liquid chromatography tandem UV
spectrophotometry high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC/UV/HRMS). The new analogues were
assayed for cytotoxicity, autophagy stimulation and the ability of the compounds to protect
from hydrogen peroxide derived oxidative stress in a SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. All of
the new compounds show low toxicity, stimulate autophagy and provide various levels of
protection form oxidative stress indicating these compounds as potential drug leads for the
treatment of neuro-degenerative disorders related to dysfunctional autophagy and or
oxi-dative stress..

Glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter in the Central Nervous System of vertebrates
and exerts its actions through the activation of specific membrane receptors and
transporters. Over-stimulation of glutamatergic receptors results in neuronal death, a
phenomenon known as excitotoxicity. Therefore, extracellular glu-tamate levels have to be
tightly regulated through a family of high-affinity transporters expressed in neurons and
glial cells. Most of the uptake process occurs in the glial compartment via
a biochemical coupling known as glutamate/glutamine shuttle that is involved in the turnover
of this excitatory neurotransmitter. Among the variety of freely accessible Central Nervous
System stimulants, modafinil is widely used as a wakefulness agent although it has also been
recommended for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and impaired
cognition. Due to these properties, nowadays it has become a popular drug among youngsters.
Despite the fact that the mechanism of action of this drug is far from being understood, it
increases glutamate extracellular levels. In order to characterize the involvement of
glutamate/glutamine shuttle in the effects of modafinil, we used the well-established model
of chick cerebellar Bergmann glia primary cultures. Acute treatment with modafinil results
in a significant increase in [3H]-D-Aspartate uptake, apparently related to an
augmentation of the affinity of the transport..

An expected decrease in [3H]-Glutamine uptake, result from a change in the
affinity of the transporters, was also found. Long-term exposure to the stimulant is likely
to affect the protein synthesis process. Our results suggest that glial cells are targets of
modafinil through the modulation of the glutamate turnover process..

Postal 14-740, Mexico D.F.m Mexico. the use of silica nanoparticles is increasingly frequent
due to its applications in various biotechnological areas. the neurotoxicity of these
particles has been based mainly, but not exclusively, on epide-miological studies in which
exposure to NPS is associated with degenerative diseases such as Alzheimeŕs disease and some
others in which there is a neuronal dysfunction. Taking into consideration that glial cells
participate in the regulation of neuronal communication, in this work we evaluated the
effect of NPS-SiO2 exposure on the function and signaling of glutamate plasma membrane
transporters in radial glial cells from the human retina (MIO-M1 cells). Confluent
monolayers were exposed to NPS-SiO2 at different concentrations (0.4 and 44.8 micrograms/ml
for 3, 6, and 12 hours of exposure). No significant reduction os mitochondrial activity was
found under these conditions. Therefore, the cells were exposed to different concentrations
od silica NPS (0.4, 4.8, 8, 15, and 20 micrograms/ml for different time periods (15, 30, 60,
and 90 minutes). The phosphorylation pattern of extracellular-regulated kinases (ERK 1 and
2) was determined. Phospho ERK 1/2 were evident at 30 minutes of the treatment with NPS at
both concentrations (0.4, and 4.8 micrograms/ ml). Our results suggest that exposure to
silica nanoparticles alters the proteome od glial cell by modulating the key signaling
pathways in the transcriptional and translational control of gene expresión..

OBJECTIVES: Located in the brainstem, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is known to play
important roles in numerous functions of the brain such as nociception and sleep. Being also
involved in locomotion, this nucleus has recently generated a great interest since it can be
targeted by deep brain stimulation (DBS) to alleviate postural instability and gait
disturbances that affect many parkinsonian patients. Studies that assessed the exact
anatomical position of the PPN remain controversial. This project aims to produce a detailed
human brainstem atlas allowing a precise localization of the PPN, and to characterize the
neurochemical content of the cells that compose this brainstem nucleus. METHODS: To achieve
our goal, we performed a high-resolution post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
of a human brainstem followed by histological staining. In addition, other sections taken
through the PPN of human and cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis)
brainstems were stained for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and for nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide-diaphorase (NADPH-δ). RESULTS: The MRI, combined with 45 anatomical plates
presenting equally-spaced histological sections stained for Cresyl Violet and Luxol Fast
Blue, allowed us to precisely localize the PPN at the ponto-mesencephalic junction. Our
stereological studies have led us to estimate at 58 100 the number of ChAT+ neurons of the
human PPN, contained in a volume of 145 mm3. Our 3D reconstructions indicate a
significant degree of overlap between neurons of the PPN, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus,
locus coeruleus and substantia nigra. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our work provides a better
anatomical and neurochemical description of the PPN and could help in a better placement of
DBS electrodes, increasing the clinical outcomes for Parkinson's disease patients..

FLUORIDE EXPOSURE DISRUPTS GLUTAMINE TRANSPORT IN RETINAL MÜLLER GLIAL CELLS

Toxicología, Mexico, Mexico
.

Glutamine is the most abundant extracellular amino acid in the Central Nervous System. It
is the main precursor of the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters: glutamate and
GABA, respectively. The GABA/glutamate/glutamine shuttle provides neurons with glutamine,
which is transported through a family of sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporters of
the slc38a gene family. System N glutamine transporters, SNAT3 and SNAT5
are expressed in glial cells and supply neurons with glutamine in a Na+-dependent
manner. Interestingly enough Li+ can replace Na+ albeit the efficiency
of the transport diminishes. Fluoride, an environmental pollutant present in dental
products, food, pesticides and water, severely impairs cognitive functions in exposed
population, likely through a disruption of glutamatergic and/or GABAergic
neurotrans-mission. Taking into consideration the pivotal role of glial SNATs in the
recycling of these amino acid transmitters, we evaluated the effect of F− acute
exposure in the functional expression of SNAT3 and SNAT5 in a human retina Müller glia cell
line. A roughly 20% reduction in [3H]glutamine uptake was present upon a 500 µM
F− treatment for 30 min. Michaelis-Menten analysis revealed a reduction in
Vmax. As expected, Immunochemical experiments demonstrated a reduction of both SNAT3 and 5
protein levels in the plasma membrane of F− exposed cultures. These results
support the idea of glia cells as an important target of neurotoxicants..

Synapse formation is a hallmark of central nervous system development and function, being
regulated by a cluster of cellular, environmental and molecular cues. Among those,
astrocytes are well known in contributing to synaptogenesis, providing both
contact-dependent signals and soluble factors, such as Hevin and SPARC. The myelination
process and its associated proteins, such as Nogo-A, are remarkable in acting as inhibitory
cues on synapse formation and plasticity in the CNS. Although astrocytes express receptors
for Nogo-A, it is still unknown whether Nogo-A signaling modulates astrocyte-mediated
synapse formation. Therefore, here we investigated the effect of Nogo-A on synaptic
regulation modulated by astrocytes, both in vitro and in a murine model of cuprizone induced
demyelination. Our data in vitro show cortical astrocytes respond to Nogo-A through RhoA
pathway activation, exhibiting stress fiber formation and decreased ramified morphology.
These alterations are associated with decreased mRNA levels of synaptogenesis-associated
genes Hevin, glypican-4, TGF-β1 and BDNF, and decreased and increased protein levels of
Hevin and SPARC, respectively. Reduction of production and release of pro-synaptogenic
soluble factors was confirmed by treatment of neuronal cultures with conditioned medium from
astrocytes exposed to Nogo-A, which led to a decrease in the number of mature synapses in
vitro. Those results were corroborated by data from our demyelination model. Under these
conditions, reduced immunostaining for Nogo-A in the visual cortex was accompanied by higher
levels of Hevin expression in astrocytes and increase in excitatory synapse density.
Therefore, we suggest that interaction between astrocytes and Nogo-A is biologically
relevant to synapse function, and may act as potential therapeutic targets in demyelinating
diseases..

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency in the world. Pregnant
women are particularly susceptible to ID due to enhanced iron (Fe) requirements needed for
fetal development. Lead (Pb), unlike Fe, is a nonessential divalent metal previously used in
commercial products until it was linked to various pathologies and developmental deficits.
Despite regulatory efforts, Pb is still a ubiquitous environmental toxin. The separate
impacts of ID and Pb exposure on the developing brain have been studied extensively;
however, there is a paucity of research considering co-exposure. Greater understanding of
the neurodevelopmental outcome of co-exposure is essential as ID and Pb both impact
individuals of lower socioeconomic status and have been associated with similar
neurodevelopmental and behavioral deficits. Additionally, whether in the form of a
deficiency of Fe or a presence of Pb, both Fe and Pb are divalent metals that can perturb
the homeostasis of other essential metals. Some essential metals have been reported to
respond to Fe levels and of particular interest to our lab, the contributions of regional
disturbances in these other essential metals to later neuro-logical impairments observed
under ID, Pb, or co-exposure have yet to be resolved. Using a dietary mouse model of ID
combined with life-long Pb exposure, we conducted Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses of various essential metals in the brain tissue of early
postnatal mice. As early as postnatal day 6 (PND6), mild tissue ID significantly enhanced Pb
accumulation in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and our exposures further led to
region-specific changes in overall metal homeostasis. Interestingly, the accumulation of Pb
in ID brain tissue was mirrored by accumulation of Pb in astrocytes in
vitro, cells that have been described to play a role in metal handling and
buffering. We are currently investigating the short and long-term cellular consequences of
these profound disruptions in metal homeostasis. (Supported by R01HD094563).

3-O-Sulfogalactosylceramide (sulfatide) is a sphingolipid that constitutes up to 4% of
total myelin lipids in the central nervous system. Previously, our lab ultrastructurally
characterized a mouse with a constitutively disrupted cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST)
gene. CST catalyzes the final step in the production of sulfatide. Consequentially, the
constitutive CST “knockout” mice are incapable of synthesizing sulfatide. Using this mouse,
our lab has shown that sulfatide is required for proper establishment and maintenance the
axoglial junctions and that provide stability to the nodal domains. In addition, we reported
that sulfatide is involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation, proliferation, and may play a
role in protein compartmentalization within the myelin sheath. Interestingly, some
ultrastructural pathologies that we reported in the CST KO mice are consistent with
structural abnormalities observed in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Moreover, sulfatide has been
reported to be reduced in regions of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) of MS patients.
Reduction of this lipid in regions of NAWM suggests that sulfatide depletion is independent
of demyelination and may be a driving force of disease pathology, not merely a consequence
of disease progression. However, since MS is typically diagnosed in young adults, the
constitutive CST KO mouse has limited clinical relevance since these mice develop in the
absence of the lipid. In order to generate a more clinically relevant model, our lab has
generated a “floxed” CST mouse, which provides both temporal and cell specific ablation of
the CST gene. Using this mouse, mated against the PLP-creERT mouse we are investigating the
structural and functional consequence that adult onset sulfatide depletion has on myelin
sheath and axonal domain integrity and on oligodendrocyte function. Our data suggests that
sulfatide depletion in the adult CNS causes nodal pathology and subsequent functional
deficits to myelinated axons..

Microglia play essential roles in proper CNS development, tissue homeostasis, and responses
to disease and injury. While performing such diverse functional roles, microglia show wide
variation of key attributes such as morphology, and phagocytic behaviors across age, region,
and disease/injury context. The mechanisms that regulate many of these dynamic changes in
microglia are not well understood. In macrophages – peripheral immune cells like microglia –
mito-chondria are central regulators of key cellular attributes like phagocytosis. Indeed,
recent studies indicate that mitochondria carry out numerous intracellular signaling
functions in addition to ATP-production and may have distinct functional roles in different
cell types. Surprisingly, little is known about microglial mitochondria, including whether
they can act as central regulators of key microglial attributes. In this study, we sought to
map the mitochondrial landscape within microglia and to understand how mitochondrial status
relates to differences in microglial attributes across brain region, development, and aging.
Using a mouse that we generated with GFP targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane in
microglia, we analyzed microglial mitochondria in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and
nucleus accumbens (NAc), where microglia show distinct cellular phenotype and distinct
expression of mitochondrial genes. Using confocal microscopy in fixed tissue and 3D
reconstruction in Imaris, we analyzed microglial mitochondrial abundance, length, and
formation of branched networks in these mice during development, adulthood and aging in VTA
and NAc. We found that mitochondria in young adult mice make up around 4% and 5.5% of the
total micro-glial volume in NAc and VTA, respectively. Qualitatively, microglial
mitochondria seem less abundant and have less branched networks compared to macrophage
mitochondria. We also observed prominent distinctions in microglial mitochondrial morphology
between development, adulthood, and aging. Using FACS-based analyses and dyes sensitive to
mitochondrial membrane potential, we observed regional and age-related differences in
microglial mitochondrial membrane potential. Our results provide a previously unavailable
map of microglial mitochondrial status and lay the foundation for understanding how these
organelles regulate microglial function in diverse physiological and pathological
contexts..

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prevalent condition affecting approximately 1.7 million
individuals annually in the United States.SB-3CT, a mechanism-based selective gelatinase
inhibitor provides neuroprotection by ameliorating secondary injury after TBI. SB-3CT is
poorly water-soluble and is metabolized to p-OH SB-3CT, a more potent
gelatinase inhibitor than SB-3CT. The water-soluble p-NH-arginine prodrug
(ND-478) is hydrolyzed to the active MMP-9 inhibitor p-amino SB-3CT
(ND-322), which is N-acetylated to ND- 364; only the latter reaches
therapeutic concentrations in the brain. In this study, we performed an electromagnetic
controlled cortical impact TBI model in mice, and subsequently treated these animals with
ND-478, ND-322 or ND-364 using different routes of administration. We found that mice
administered with ND-364 intra-peritoneally (i.p.) at an early stage of
post-injury, followed by subsequent subcutaneous (s.c.) doses of ND-364
inhibited MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity, reduced brain lesion volumes, and improved mouse
complex motor coordination and sensorimotor function significantly. Treatment with other
strategies only have showed partial functional improvement. The recently developed water
soluble p- methylamino analog ((R)-ND-336) is>20-fold
more potent MMP-9 inhibitor than SB-3CT. (R)-ND-336 was intravenously
(i.v.) injected 2 hours post-injury and subsequent daily
s.c. doses. We found that (R)-ND-336 effectively
improved sensorimotor function short-term after TBI. The continuing studies are examining
brain lesion, motor coordination defect, stress-induced welfare loss not only in short-term,
but also long-term after TBI. These findings indicate that gelatinase inhibitor analogs of
SB-3CT hold considerable promise as potential treatments of gelatinase-dependent injury
after TBI. Support: AHA Grant 09NSDG2260983; Dana Foundation; MU PAS Research Fund (Z.G.);

Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) is an injury-induced cytokine and LIF haplodeficient mice
show desynchronized glial responses, increased neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits
after injury. Given the importance of LIF in recovery processes after traumatic brain injury
(TBI), we sought to test the efficacy of intranasal (IN) LIF in a pediatric mouse model of
mild closed head injury (mCHI). We assessed sensorimotor function and markers of
neuroinflammation in wild type mice treated with IN-vehicle or IN-LIF. Two doses of LIF –
10 µl (20 ng) and 20 µl (40 ng) administered 2X daily for 3 days – were evaluated, of which
20 µl dose led to better recovery of sensorimotor function. Therefore, an intranasal dose of
20 µl was used for all subsequent studies. Mice treated with 20 µl of IN-LIF exhibited
improved performance over IN-vehicle treated mice on the modified Neurological Severity
Score, horizontal beam walk and horizontal ladder. At 5 days of recovery, astrogliosis (GFAP
expression) and microgliosis (Iba-1 and CD-68 expression) were significantly reduced in the
injured cortex of IN-LIF treated group over IN-vehicle but did not differ significantly from
sham operated group. Punctate amyloid precursor protein accumulation, indicative of
axonopathy, was observed in IN-vehicle group that was significantly reduced by IN-LIF.
However, there was no evidence of cortical or white matter demyelination at this early time
point as indicated by myelin basic protein (MBP) immunostaining. Western blot analyses of
protein constituents of blood brain barrier (BBB) showed no significant differences implying
that BBB integrity was largely intact. Altogether, these data further support the role of
LIF as an important neuroprotective cytokine that modulates astroglial and microglial
responses in the acute phase following injury. LIF also prevents early axonal damage. Our
studies suggest that elevating levels of LIF via IN administration during
the acute phase following mild TBI is a prospective therapeutic for improving neurological
function..

CORTICAL BRAIN INJURY CAUSES RETROGRADE DEGENERATION OF AFFERENT BASAL FOREBRAIN
CHOLINERGIC NEURONS VIA THE P75NTR

Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) extend long projections to multiple targets in
the brain to regulate cognitive functions and are compromised in numerous neurodegenerative
disorders. To assess how injury to the target region of these neurons affects their
viability in vivo, we are using the Fluid Percussion Injury (FPI) model to
test the effects of injury at the cortex on the afferent BFCNs. Our preliminary studies show
significantly fewer BFCNs ipsilateral to the injury compared to the contralateral side of
the brain 7 and 14 days after the injury, an effect which is absent in p75 knock-out mice.
These results suggest a retrograde degenerative effect of the cortical injury on the
projecting BFCNs through p75NTR. Basal forebrain survival, growth, synaptic maintenance, and
apoptosis is governed primarily by neurotrophins (NT). Treatment of BFCN neurons with mature
NTs promote survival via the Trk family of receptors, while pro-neurotrophins (pro-NT)
trigger apoptosis via p75NTR. Interestingly BFCNs express all the neurotrophin receptors
throughout life and may access NTs locally or from their targets. To determine the effects
of NT and proNT signaling on BFCN viability and function, we are using microfluidic and
filter chamber cultures to segregate BFCN soma and axons in vitro allowing
for compartmentalized treatment with pro/mature NTs. Our studies show that stimulation of
BFCN axon terminals with proNGF which is a ligand for p75NTR, elicits retrograde
degeneration of the axons and cell death of these neurons in vitro.
Moreover, exposure of these neurons to mature or proNTs in the axonal or soma compartments
may activate specific signaling mechanisms with different functional consequences. The
knowledge of how pro or mature NTs affect axonal integrity and BFCN survival will shape our
understanding of the role of NTs in BFCN development and in conditions of
neuro-degeneration..

The discovery of effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
could be advanced by studying the underlying disease biology vis-à-vis iron dyshomeostasis
and molecules that modulate nAChRs. Nicotine, being an allosteric modulator of nAChRs,
improves memory loss in AD without the withdrawal symptoms observed in orthosteric ligands
of nAChRs. Ascorbic acid (AA), on the other hand, is a potent antioxidant molecule with
known neuromodulatory effects. This study evaluated the neurotherapeutic advantages of
combining Nicotine and ascorbic acid. Following institutional ethical approval
(UERC/ASN/2018/1473), five groups (A-E) of male Wistar rats (n=8/group) were used for this
study. Group A (control) was treated with distilled water daily for 8weeks.
Transferrin-mediated neuroinflammation was induced in groups B-E through a daily oral
infusion with 100 mg/kg of AlCl3 for four weeks. Groups C-E were then post-treated with
ascorbic acid (100 mg/kg daily), nicotine (10 mg/kg daily) and nicotine (10mg/kg
daily)+ascorbic acid (100mg/kg daily) respectively for four weeks. Following neurobehavioral
tests to assess memory indices, the animals were euthanized for post-mortem studies. We
observed that aluminium induced a reduction in long-and short-term memory indices in
addition to perturbed cholinergic activities in the PFC and hippocampus. Atomic absorption
spectrometric analysis of these brain regions revealed an increase in intracellular iron,
which corresponded to overexpression of transferrin receptor protein (TRP).
Nicotine-ascorbic acid treatment regimen reversed the reduction of long-and short-term
memory indices through the restoration of the cholinergic system. These correlated with
nicotine-dependent modulation of TRP expression, which was complemented by a significant
attenuation of reactive oxygen species mediated by ascorbic acid. Summarily, our results
have shown the role of ascorbic acid in enhancing nicotine neuromodulatory activities in
transferrin-mediated behavioral decline and neuroinflammation in the PFC and hippocampus of
Wistar rats..

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease of the central nervous
system and a major cause of neurological disability in young adults. The adult brain is
able, up to a certain level, to repair damaged myelin prompting to the formation of new
myelin sheath. However is a failing process that eventually leads to neuroin-flammation and
neurodegeneration. For this reason, investigating possible strategies to promote
remyelination could be a path to pursue. Microglia has a fundamental role in the processes
of re-mye-lination: it activates after myelin damage and removes myelin debris, which is a
limiting step for the remyelination process. Recombinant Human antibody IgM22 (rHIgM22) is
able to successfully promote myelin repair in all mouse models of MS and, although little is
known about its mechanism of action, it stimulates microglia clearance of myelin debris.
Previously we observed deep changes in the sphingolipid pattern of cells belonging to the
oligodendrocyte lineage after treatment with rHIgM22 and, since the antibody increases
phagocytic activity in the microglial cell line BV-2, we decided to analyse this cell line
through a steady-state metabolic labelling with 3H-sphingosine. Radiolabelled
lipids were extracted, partially purified, separated by High Performance Thin Layer
Chromatography and quantitatively analysed by digital auto-radiography. As a result, we
observed significant changes in the lipid composition of BV-2 cells respect to control,
mainly an increase of several gangliosides, whose exact identity is currently being
determined through ESI mass spectrometry. Literature suggests that the mechanism of action
of rHIgM22 might be mediated by the reorganization of sphingolipid-driven signalling
complexes at cell surface, in cholesterol and sphingolipid enriched domains. After
clarifying which lipids are involved in the rHIgM22 mediated signalling, we will investigate
which proteins could be involved in the activity of these signalling complexes and if
modulation of the composition of the lipid microenvironment could affect their activity, and
thus microglia function..

Disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) results from neu-ronal and axonal loss.
Prolonged cuprizone (CPZ) intoxication is widely used as a MS model because it triggers
chronic demyelination, neurodegeneration, astrogliosis and microgliosis. Exacerbated
microglia (MG) activation is associated with impaired remyelination and neurodegeneration.
As MG are physiologically dependent on colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R)
signaling, MG can be almost completely eliminated from the brain using CSF-1R inhibitors.
Therefore, the present work aimed to evaluate the effects of CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945 on
myelin status, neurodegeneration and astrogliosis during chronic CPZ demyelination. Mice
were fed either control or CPZ chow for 12 weeks and orally gavaged vehicle or BLZ945 from
the 2nd week of CPZ treatment. BLZ945 induced a reduction in the microglial population in
all structures evaluated. Astrogliosis was attenuated only in the cortex (CX), cerebellum
(CB) and forceps major of the corpus callosum (fmjCC). A recovery in myelin basic protein
(MBP) and Sudan black (SB) staining showed BLZ945 to protect myelin. The percentage of
MBP-positive area increased in CX and throughout the CC, while SB intensity increased in the
CB, fmjCC, anterior corpus callosum (aCC), fimbria of the hippocampus (FI) and striatum
(ST). However, positive amino-cupric-silver staining was more prominent in axons traversing
the ST and fibers throughout the CC with BLZ945 treatment. Axonal degeneration was
accompanied by terminal axonal ovoids character-istic of inflammatory demyelination. These
results indicate that neurodegeneration does not exclusively result from demyelination and
that MG depletion could prevent demyelination but also exacerbate axonal degeneration..

Dysregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasomal system (UPS) enables pathogenic accumulation of
disease-driving proteins in neurons across a host of neurological disorders. However,
whether and how the UPS contributes to oligodendrocyte dysfunction and repair after white
matter injury (WMI) remains undefined. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL
interacts with Daam2 and their mutual antagonism regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation
during development. Using proteomic analysis of the Daam2–VHL complex coupled with
conditional genetic knockout mouse models, we further discovered that another E3 ligase
Nedd4 is required for developmental myelination through stabilization of VHL via K63-linked
ubiquitination. Furthermore, studies in mouse demyelination models and white matter lesions
from patients with multiple sclerosis corroborate the function of this pathway during
remyelination after WMI. Overall, these studies provide evidence that a signaling axis
involving key UPS components contributes to oligodendrocyte development and repair and
reveal a new role for Nedd4 in glial biology..

INFLAMMATION, MYELINATION, AND AXON DEGENERATION GENES ARE MODIFIED IN EXPERIMENTAL
AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITITIS OPTIC NERVES
.

Visual dysfunction is a prevalent feature in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune,
inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Visual dysfunction
can be attributed to optic neuritis (ON) leading to vision loss, pain with eye movement, and
deficiency in color vision. Considering ON is an early marker of MS, deterioration seen in
the optic nerve may reflect pathology occurring in the CNS during disease. To explore
potential targets for MS therapies, screening for proteins that mediate characteristic
events in MS is imperative but difficult. Experimental autoimmune encephalo-myelitis (EAE)
is one of the best models of MS and shows significant deficits in functional visual evoked
potentials due to EAE-induced demyelination, inflammation, and axon degeneration. To
investigate gene changes seen during MS optic neuritis, RNA from optic nerves of mice with
EAE was extracted for NanoString nCounter gene analysis. Genes were categorized into three
pathways that include neuroinflammation, myelination, and axon degeneration. A total of 760
genes were identified with 136 genes related to neuro-inflammation. In EAE, significant
upregulation was observed in C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, and C3, all involved in the complement
cascade within the innate immune system. Genes related to cytokines and chemokines
demonstrate significant upregulation such as Ccl12, Ccl5, Cxcl10, Cxcl16, and Cxcr4. In
addition, 13 oligodendrocyte-specific genes were identified, 6 of which are related to
myelination. Genes include fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (Fa2h), galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase 1
(Gal3st1), gap junction protein 1 (Gjb1), myelin regulatory factor (Myrf), and UDP
galactosyltransferase 8A (Ugt8a). Significant downregulation in myelination genes such as
Gjb1, SRY-Box Transcription Factor 10 (Sox10), oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2
(Olig2), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin basic protein (MBP), and Myrf
were observed. Axon degeneration was evident with significant downregulation of PTEN Induced
Kinase 1 (PINK1) and S100 Calcium Binding Protein B (S100B). These data demonstrate that
specific genes related to inflammation, demyelination, and axon degeneration are modified in
EAE. These genes can be possible targets for new treatments to alleviate optic neuritis in
EAE and MS..

Recently, the myelin proteolipid protein gene (Plp1) was shown to be
expressed in glia of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in mouse..

However, beyond this, not much is known about its expression in intestine. To address this
matter, we investigated Plp1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in
intestine from mice at different ages (postnatal days 2, 9, 21 and 88). Here we show that
Plp1 expression preferentially occurs during early postnatal development,
primarily as the DM20 isoform. Interestingly, the protein does not appear to be
posttranslationally modified (i.e., lipidated) in intestine as Plp1
products are in brain, based on differences in migration with SDS-PAGE. Moreover, by
immunohistochemical analysis using cell type-specific markers, we demonstrate that the gene
is expressed in neurons of the ENS, in addition to glia. Furthermore, through use of a
couple of related Plp1-lacZ transgenic mouse lines, we show that the wmN1
enhancer region in Plp1 intron 1 DNA is required for expression in
intestine..

DNA METHYLATION DEPENDENT GLAST TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL IN GLIA
.

Ada Rodriguez, Arturo Ortega.

Excitotoxicity is a form of neuronal death caused by hyperactivity of the main excitatory
amino acid, glutamate (Glu). An uncontrolled receptor-meditated calcium influx triggers a
plethora of signaling pathways resulting a death cascade. The constant exposure to several
xenobiotics over the years can have a significant impact in the central nervous system
(CNS), leading in the long-term run to an excitotoxic process. Hence, the extracellular
levels of Glu must be tightly regulated in order to avoid prolonged receptor activation to
this end, glial Glu transporters (GLAST, Glt-1) uptake Glu from the synaptic cleft after its
release from the synaptic terminal, maintaining a homeo-static environment. The expression
of these transporters under excitotoxic Glu concentrations has been widely studied, for
example, the AMPA subtype of Glu receptors down regulates chglast (slc1A3) transcription via
YY1 in a PKC-mediated signaling cascade. The YY1 transcription factor, as a member of the
Polycomb group can be part of repressive and activating chromatin remodeling groups. Thus,
YY-1 can target DNA methyltransferases or dioxygenases of methyl-ated cytosines to specific
DNA sequences and by these means regulate the transcription of specific genes. Being the
slc1A3 promoter an important target of YY1 involved its downregulation under excito-toxic
conditions, we use here the well-characterized chick primary culture of Bergmann glia cells
(BGC) and the human retina Muller MIO-M1 cells to address the epigenetic mechanisms
associated to GLAST gene expression regulation. Thus far, we have been able to detect
changes in YY1, DNMT3 and GLAST mRNA and protein levels in response to excitotoxic Glu
levels. Likewise, global DNA methylation has been evaluated the same conditions. Moreover,
in order to understand the effect of DNA methylation on GLAST function, 1 we evaluated the
activity of this transporter after treatment with 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine an hypomethylation
agent. These results favor the notion of a complex epigenetic regulation of GLAST
expression..

AQP4 STOP CODON READTHROUGH FACILITATES AMYLOID-Β CLEARANCE FROM THE BRAIN
.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is initiated by the toxic aggregation of Amyloid beta (Aβ).
Immunotherapeutics aimed at reducing Aβ are in clinical trials but with very limited success
to date. Identification of orthogonal approaches for clearing Aβ may complement these
approaches for treating AD. In the brain, the astrocytic water channel Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is
involved in clearance of Aβ, and the fraction of AQP4 found perivascularly is decreased in
AD. Further, an unusual stop codon readthrough event generates a conserved C-terminally
elongated variant of AQP4 (AQP4X), which is exclusively perivascular. However, it is unclear
if the AQP4X variant specifically mediates Aβ clearance. Here, using AQP4
readthrough-specific knockout mice that still express normal AQP4, we determine this isoform
indeed mediates Aβ clearance. Further, with high-throughput screening and counterscreening,
we identify small molecule compounds that enhance readthrough of the AQP4 sequence, and
validate a subset on endogenous astrocyte AQP4. Finally, we demonstrate these compounds
enhance brain Aβ clearance in vivo, which depends on AQP4X. This suggests
derivatives of these compounds may provide a viable pharmaceutical approach to enhance
clearance of Aβ and potentially other aggregating proteins in neuro-degenerative
disease..

Toxoplasma gondii is a neurotropic protozoan parasite that infects ∼30% of
the global population, and chronic infection has been linked to neuropathologies such as
schizophrenia and seizure disorders. Evidence in mice suggests that chronic infection
affects neuronal function in a variety of ways. In particular, murine and cell-based
experiments have shown that T. gondii can increase both levels of dopamine
and markers for dopamine synthesis localized to parasite cysts. In order to unravel how
T. gondii impacts brain function, a more complete understanding of
infection induced alterations in dopaminergic circuitry is needed. Our interest was to
characterize how the parasite may alter the expression of host genes involved in
neurotransmitter metabolism, transport, and signaling in several areas of the brain relevant
to dopaminergic circuits. Adult C57BL/6J mice were chronically infected with Type II ME49
T. gondii cysts follwed by microdissection of tissue from prefrontal
cortex, striatum, amygdala, and ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra. Gene expression
analysis was then conducted in these 4 regions for 11 relevant genes normalized to actin.
Our results show that chronically infected mice exhibit a consistent pattern of
transcriptional down-regulation among genes involved in dopaminergic circuits, as well as
glutamate signaling and metabolism. This pattern was most pro-nounced in the ventral
tegmental area/substantia nigra. At this stage, no clear pattern has emerged reflecting
possible functional consequences of these changes. Nonetheless, our results can aid in the
understanding of mechanisms responsible for behavioral and neuropsychological changes in
mice and humans. Moving forward, we aim to further investigate parasite induced derangements
in neural circuits by analyzing levels of dopamine directly, as well as continuing
preliminary immunostaining experiments to look for changes in expression and localization of
proteins identified by our gene expression data..

A metabolic shift favoring ceramide production over sphingosine- 1-phosphate (S1P),
contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Once the drug FTY720 phosphorylated,
mimics S1P bio-activity but with an unclear underlying mechanism. In our study, Two doses of
FTY720 (0.1 mg / kg and 0.5 mg / kg daily) were given by oral gavage to transgenic mouse
models of familial AD carrying human apolipoprotein E. After 12 weeks of treatment, animals
were challenged with behavioral tests for memory, locomotion and anxiety. Blood was
withdrawn and brains were collected for sphingo-lipids analysis by mass spectrometry, RT-PCR
and Aβ quantification also performed with the brain. The results showed that sphingosine
kinase 1 was downregulated in E3FAD while S1P lyase was upre-gulated in E4FAD. In the cortex
of E3FAD and E4FAD, Cer d18:1/ 16:0 and Cer d18:1/22:0 levels were elevated compared to
litter controls. Low levels of S1P in the plasma were associated with higher probability of
failing the memory test. FTY720 increased the likelihood of E4FAD to succeed in the memory
test by 1.8-fold and reduced anxious behavior in APOE4 mice. Furthermore. FTY720 reduced
ceramide and sphingomyelin levels, inflammation and Aβ concentration in E4FAD cortex. Our
data indicates that FTY720 improves memory and anxious behavior in FAD mice, not only by
antagonist effects on S1P receptors, but also by acting on the sphingolipid metabolism in
the brain..

Omega 3 fatty acids have been shown to increase core body temperature (Tb) in
mammals and omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are known to influence Tb
in hibernators. Hibernation, in part, is controlled by the central nervous system.
Tb in hibernation is hypothesized to be regulated by the hypothalamic
set-point. To the best of our knowledge, no one has investigated the influence of omega 3
fatty acids on the hibernating Tb of Arctic Ground Squirrel (AGS) or on
hypothalamic fatty-acid derived neural signaling mechanisms. We hypothesized feeding omega 3
fatty acids would modulate Tb in hibernating AGS and influence PUFA-derived
signaling lipids in the hypothalamus..

Wild juvenile AGS were fed either a diet high in omega 3 fatty acids or a standard chow
control diet, high in omega 6 fatty acids, prior to hibernation. Tb was tracked
with abdominal data loggers. Whole brain, white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue
(BAT) and plasma were collected during distinct stages of hibernation (torpor and arousal).
Hypothalamic endocannabinoids and fatty acid amides and BAT, WAT and plasma fatty acids were
measured..

Results show increased Tb during hibernation in animals fed a high omega 3 diet
and increased BAT mass (p<0.05, t-test). Additionally, DHA and omega 3 fatty acids were
increased in animals fed a high omega 3 diet (p<0.05, t-test). Results did not support
our hypothesis that diet would alter major hypothalamic endocannabinoids, but we found
hypothalamic palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a fatty acid amide, and 2-AG, an endocannabinoid,
increased during torpor compared to the euthermic phase of hibernation, arousal (p<0.05,
t-test). In conclusion, our results indicate a dietary omega 3s modulate Tb of
hibernating AGS. While diet did not influence hypothalamic endo-cannabinoids, hibernators
showed seasonal trends in endo-cannabinoids..

Ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1) is the main neuronal ceramide synthase. CerS1 catalyzes the
generation of C18 ceramide. We have previously reported a catalytically inactive
mutation of CerS1 resulting in 50% reduction of brain C18 ceramide and
significant increases in sphingoid bases causing Purkinje cell degradation and cerebellar
ataxia. Ectopic expression of CerS2 in the neurons of the CerS1 mutant restores sphingoid
bases to wild type levels, rescues Purkinje cells from degradation, and eliminates the
ataxia phenotype. CerS2 isoform shares the same sphingoid base substrates as CerS1, but
catalyzes the production of long-chain ceramides (C22-C24)..

Therefore, the expression of CerS2 transgene in CerS1 mutant neurons did not restore wild
type levels of C18 ceramides. In our current work, we performed RNA-seq analyses
of the cerebella of the wild type, CerS1 mutant, and CerS1 mutant/CerS2 transgenic mice. The
mRNAs reduced in CerS1 mutants were predominantly from genes expressed by Purkinje cells.
220 of these mRNAs were restored to wild type levels by ectopic expression of CerS2.
Statistically overrepresented annotations linked to these genes include neuro-genesis,
synaptic functions, calcium signaling, pleckstrin homology domain proteins, and SH3 domain
proteins. In addition, we identified 110 mRNAs increased as a result of CerS1 mutation and
normalized by CerS2 transgene expression. G-protein coupled receptor signaling and members
of the complement system were overrepresented biological processes among these mRNAs.
However, the molecular phenotype of rescued Cers1 mutants remained distinct from wild type
mice, with 385 differentially abundant mRNAs showing overrepresentation of synapse function,
ion transport, and transcriptional regulation annotations. Taken together, these results
suggest that increased levels of sphingoid bases due to CerS1 deficiency affect the
expression of genes critical for the survival and maintenance of cerebellar neurons.
Moreover, our results predict that differences in the sphingolipids’ fatty acyl chain-length
produce functionally distinct cerebellar neurons when Cers2 is used to rescue defects caused
by CerS1 mutation..

Down syndrome (DS) is caused by triplication of chromosome 21. It is the most common
genetic form of intellectual disability with a prevalence of 1 in 750 live births. Trisomy
21 results in global transcriptional dysregulation and previous work has shown that one of
the alterations is the downregulation of a network of genes regulating the oligodendrocyte
(OL) lineage. This suggests that perturbed OL development may be cause of the decrease in
white matter in the brains of people with DS. To study the mechanism of this deficit, we
differentiated two isogenic lines of iPSCs derived from people with DS into neural
progenitor cells (NPCs) and pre-oligodendrocyte pro-genitor cells (pre-OPCs). We identified
changes in the transition of trisomic cells from NPCs to pre-OPCs. This transition is
tightly regulated by two transcription factors, OLIG2 and NKX2.2, which are essential to
promote the commitment and differentiation of OLs. Upon application of a Sonic hedgehog
pathway agonist (SAG), trisomic cells show a significant increase in OLIG2 expression at the
RNA and protein level and a significant decrease in the expression of
Nkx2.2 at the RNA level. Hierarchal clustering and gene ontology
identifies the hedgehog signaling pathway as the most enriched pathway driving the
differentiation of the iPSCs from NPCs to pre-OPCs. Multiple genes within this pathway are
dysregulated in trisomic pre-OPCs. Based on these findings, we increased the concentration
of SAG during differentiation of the trisomic cultures and found that this treatment
normalizes the level of expression of OLIG2 and NKX2.2 in the trisomic line. These
observations imply that reduced responsiveness of trisomic cells to SHH signaling may drive
the dysregulated expression underlying the first perturbed step of OL differentiation in
DS..

Cholesterol comprises over 40% of oligodendrocyte lipid content and is often dysregulated
in neurodegenerative diseases affecting myelin integrity. Progressive loss of myelin and
impaired generation of new myelinating oligodendrocytes are hallmarks of diseases such as
multiple sclerosis. Despite the prominence of potential promye-linating drugs which target
sterol synthesis and our increasing knowledge of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity, few studies
have explored cholesterol metabolism in both the brain and spinal cord. Therefore,
understanding how cholesterol metabolism is regulated in different oligodendrocyte
populations is essential to developing effective promyelinating therapies. Our previous
study revealed that spinal cord oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have higher
expression of cholesterol synthesis enzymes than brain OPCs (Khandker et al, biorXiv),
suggesting that OPCs of different regions may rely differently on intracellular cholesterol
synthesis to support myelin production. Here we isolated O4+ oligodendroglia from the brain
and spinal cord of mice to determine expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors
which facilitate uptake of extracellular cholesterol via lipoprotein particles..

We found that low density lipo-protein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) expression is
significantly higher in brain oligodendroglia compared to spinal cord oligodendro-glia
throughout the peak of developmental myelination (P10-P18). Moreover, treatment of primary
rat OPCs with varying concentrations of LDL resulted in an increase in myelin gene
expression in brain OPCs whereas spinal cord OPCs showed no response to LDL treatment. These
data suggest brain OPCs may have a greater dependence on extracellular cholesterol uptake
rather than intracellular cholesterol synthesis..

NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs)
reside throughout the brain. They divide asymmetrically and differentiate into myelinating
oligodendrocytes throughout adulthood. OPCs have been successfully isolated from rodents
using several techniques including magnetic beads, immuno-panning and exploiting
differential centripetal adhesion. Whereas rat OPCs are relatively simple to propagate in
vitro, it has been difficult to expand mouse OPCs in vitro and even more challenging to
differentiate them once established in culture. In this study, we developed and
characterized a simple and reproducible method to prepare large numbers of nearly homogenous
cultures of primary mouse OPCs from postnatal day 0-2 mouse telencephala. Using the McCarthy
and de Vellis mechanical separation method we separated OPCs from a mixture of glial cells
and plated them onto fibronectin coated tissue culture plates in a biochemically defined
medium containing fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and platelet derived growth factor AA
(PDGFAA). These cultures were maintained in a standard tissue culture incubator. However,
they proliferated very slowly. By contrast, mouse OPCs doubled approximately every 7 days
when grown in 30% B104 neuroblastoma conditioned medium supplemented with FGF-2
(B104CM+FGF-2) and in a 2% oxygen, nitrogen buffered environment. After 3 passages, greater
than 99% of these OPCs were NG2+/PDGFRα+. In medium containing only FGF-2, mouse OPCs
progressed to late stage OPCs whereupon A2B5 expression decreased and O4 expression
increased. However, cells that remained in proliferation media, after repeated passages,
eventually progressed to a late O 4+ OPC even with B104 present. When the mitogens were
withdrawn and the medium was supplemented with T3 hormone as well as CNTF and Noggin, a
subset of the OPCs differentiated into more mature Olig2+/O4 +/ MBP+ cells. Unlike rat OPCs,
T3 or FGF2 alone were not sufficient to promote the differentiation and survival of mouse
OPCs. These studies reveal significant differences between mouse and rat OPCs and an
inhibitory role for oxygen in mouse OPC proliferation..

Here, we studied the anti-inflammatory potential of cannabidiol (CBD),the major
non-psychoactlve component of cannabis. For that we used microglial cells in culture that
were isolated from post-natal mouse brain through a procedure that relies on the adhesion
preference of these cells to the polycation poly-ethyleneimine (Sepulveda-Díaz et aI, Glia,
2016; dos-Santos Pereira et aI, Glia, 2018). We established that CBD (1-10 µM) was highly
efficient in reducing inflammatory-type responses triggered by the Toll-like receptor4
(TLR4) agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 ng/ ml). In particular, CBD strongly reduced the
release of two pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-1ß and that of glutamate,a
non-cytokine mediator of inflammation. Interestingly, CBD was also highly effective against
other inflammatory signaling molecules,theTLR-2 agonist Pam3CSK-4 and the P2X7 agonist
BzATP, indicating that CBD inhibitory effects were not restricted to a particular
inflammatory pathway.The effects of CBD were pre-dominantly receptor independent; they were
only marginally blunted by SCH336, a selective antagonist/inverse agonist at CB2 receptors
and insensitive to antagonists of CB1 receptors and PPAR-y. Additional experiments revealed
that CBD had the capacity to restrain LPS-Induced Inflammatory events by interfering with a
signaling cascade involving the ROS producing enzyme NADPH oxidase and subsequently NF-xB
dependent signaling. Importantly, we noticed that NF-KB inhibition by either CBD (1,10 µM)
or TPCA-1, an IKB kinase inhibitor counteracted the rise in glucose uptake that is observed
after exposure of microglial cells to LPS,suggesting that CBD occluded pro inflammatory
events by lowering glucose consumption. Comforting this view, CBD anti-inflammatory effects
were mimicked by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a synthetic non-metabollzable glucose analog. CBD
and 2-DG led to a reduction of glucose-derived NADPH, a requisite factor for ROS production
by NADPH oxidase. Altogether, our findings suggest that CBD possesses potent
anti-inflammatory effects towards microglial cells through an antioxidant mechanism that
restrains glucose utilization and NADPH synthesis.Present data also further confirm that CBD
may have a therapeutic interest in conditions where neuro-inflammatory processes are
prominent..

Neuroinflammation is common to neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries, resulting in
immune responses characterized by changes in astrocytes. Astrocytes ordinarily provide
critical support for neurons but become reactive in response to brain disease, injury, or
infection. Reactive astrocytes (RAs) are defined by their increased proliferation, enlarged
cell bodies and processes, and change in function. A longstanding and unresolved issue is
whether RAs contribute to or help alleviate disease progression, but overall, RAs have been
discovered to be an important contributor to several neurological diseases.
Toxoplasma gondii infects a third of the world's population and is
asymptomatic except during times of immunocompromise when infection leads to severe
neurological damage. Toxoplasma is a highly successful neurotropic parasite
that causes persistent subclinical neuroinflammation due to cyst formation in neurons
lasting for the lifetime of the host, making this a key resource for our studies. During
chronic Toxoplasma infection, RAs demonstrate a neuroprotective function by
inhibiting parasite replication via STAT1-mediated mechanisms, while simultaneously
demonstrating detrimental effects by downregulating GLT-1, suggesting hetero-geneity exists
among RAs. Utilizing flow cytometry, we have characterized surface integrin subsets found
during chronic Toxoplasma infection. Experiments demonstrate during
infection, potential chronic reactive astrocyte subsets are present. However, variability
exists within these heterogeneous astrocytic naive and infected subsets. To further
determine if astrocytes define a chronic inflammatory state, single cell RNA sequencing
experiments on bulk astro-cytes at various stages of infection were conducted to determine
if similar populations are expressed during acute compared to chronic infection.
Furthermore, to address the issue of detecting a pure RA population, we have created a
reporter mouse, Lcn2 CreERT2; Rosa26 lsl-tdTomato, that
will allow for identification of RA subsets during infection for the first time, providing a
novel tool for future use..

Ketogenic diet (KD; high-fat, low-carbohydrate) has emerged as a lifestyle change that may
promote stress resilience. This study investigates the possible resilience-promoting
properties of KD and aims to unravel underlying mechanisms by focusing on microglia
specifically, the resident immune cells of the brain. Using 2 month-old adult male C57BL/6
mice, we studied the effects of KD versus normal diet (ND) exposure for 4
weeks. The consequences of chronic stress under KD versus ND were
investigated by comparing non-stressed controls with animals undergoing 10 days of repeated
social defeat (RSD). After RSD, mice underwent a social interaction test (SIT) to classify
them as resilient or susceptible to stress. We are focusing on the ventral hippocampus CA1
stratum radiatum, previously shown to be affected by chronic stress. Our
results show that after RSD, ketogenic diet increased the proportion of resilient animals,
57.14% of KD mice (n=28) vs 36.36% of ND (n=22). We studied the effect that
ketogenic diet on its own might have on micro-glia. Using TMEM119/IBA1 double staining we
have observed that KD does not affect microglia number and distribution. Nevertheless, the
microglia of KD animals show increased soma and arborization area. This observation is very
important given that changes in micro-glia morphology suggest changes in their function,
suggesting. Further analyses of stress susceptible versus resilient
animals, together with ultrastructural studies, will expand our understanding of KD on
microglial function. Ongoing analysis using scanning electron microscopy will allow us to
perform ultrastructural characterization of microglial function, their interactions with
other cell types, synaptic elements, as well as provide valuable intracellular information
regarding their phagocytic activity and markers of cellular stress..

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating, auto-immune disorder of the
central nervous system (CNS). In MS, B cells are thought to promote disease by driving
antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses via cognate interaction dependent upon MHCII,
producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, secreting antibody, and contributing to the formation
of meningeal ectopic lymphoid tissues (ELT). ELTs are aggregates of leukocytes formed in
non-lymphatic tissue under chronic inflammation and are associated with the progression of
MS. We hypothesize that there are B cell-intrinsic properties critical for the infiltration
and retention of B cells in the meninges during EAE. Using a murine system involving the
expression of MHCII exclusively by myelin-specific B cells (BAPC mice), we
studied the potential of Th1 lines to foster the development of ELT at different time
points. BAPC mice receiving Th1 cells had a higher number of germinal center-like
B cells (GL-7+) 14 days post-onset (DPO) compared to 7dpo and 21dpo. Single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was carried out to explore the extent, diversity and phenotype of
B cells in the spinal meninges during neuroinflammation in comparison to deep cervical
draining lymph nodes (DCLN). Distinct lymphoid clusters, including CD8 T, B, NK and myeloid
lineage cells, were identified. Subcluster analysis was performed to identify the subtypes
of B cells. We observed 5 subsets that express genes associated with memory or naive B cells
such as Bcl2, Hhex, Mndal, and Cd38. These genes were higher in clusters 0, 1, and 3.
Clusters 2 and 4 have some expression of these genes but are defined by their high
expression of ribosomal or mitochondrial genes. Germinal center B cells were absent in
B-cell clusters indicating that these clusters could be immature. We believe cluster 2 and 4
to be metabolically active B cells and this information needs to be further validated..

Virtual Reality (VR) technology allows users to visualize digital models in three
dimensions. Many useful VR, Augmented Reality (AR), and screen-based applications have been
developed to teach neuroanatomy. The newest-generation commercial versions of VR equipment
allow the user to interact with the virtual environment in an intuitive way. Head, hand and
gaze tracking combine with customizable user inputs to allow rich data collection on VR user
performance. The developments described above allowed us to build teaching material that
extends beyond immersive viewing of anatomical structures to enable constructive learning
activities in VR that are customized the learner's experience with the aim of addressing
personalized knowledge gaps. We will present a workflow and a prototype VR training tool to
allow medical students to explore and interact with the molecular level anatomy and
physiology of neural components including the blood-brain barrier, tripartite synapse, and
hypothalamus/pituitary. We will demonstrate aspects of our training application that extend
beyond immersive learning to include personalized interactive learning of neurobiological
concepts..

Olfactory deficiency (OD), a characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), can lead to
diminished appetite and malnutrition. Our group and others have established a link between
ASD, OD and copy-number variations in the contactin associated protein 2 (Cntnap2) gene.
Although wild-type (WT) and Cntnap2−/- (KO) mice show similar olfactory
discrimination of odors, odor discrimination by KO mice is severely impaired in the presence
of novel background odors. Cntnap2 is expressed particularly in the nodes of Ranvier in
several brain regions, including the olfactory tract. Impaired expression leads to neuronal
migration abnormalities globally and reduced number of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in
the neocortex. We argued that this impaired neuronal function and density might be
responsible for the observed deficit in odor detection in presence of background odors.
Fluorescence imaging was used with immunolabelled coronal sections of perfused and fixed
adult mouse brains. Glutamate decarboxylase, GAD67, anti-body labelling allowed quantitation
of GABAergic inhibitory inter-neurons of WT and KO mice within the Piriform Cortex (PC), a
region in the brain associated with olfactory function. Images were captured on a Nikon C2
inverted confocal microscope, then denoised using the image-denoising module in the NIS
Elements software. The number of cell bodies of GAD67 positive neurons in the layer 1 of the
PC were counted using the NIH Fiji-Image J software. Initial analysis revealed no difference
of GAD67-positive neurons between WT and KO mice within layer 1 of the piriform cortex.
Based on this we are gathering tiled z-stack images to include all the layers of the
piriform cortex with the aim to also count the cell bodies of GABAergic neurons in the
layers 2/3 of the PC that are responsible for feedback inhibition..

In this project, we aim to understand the role of volume regulated anion channels (VRAC) on
brain tissue swelling and neuronal excitability. VRAC are activated in response to cell
swelling, and release glutamate and other anions into the extracellular space in an effort
to regulate cell volume. To study VRAC in the context of cell volume and excitability
changes, we have generated multiple transgenic mouse lines using Cre-lox technology to
selectively ablate VRAC in specific cell types (astrocytes, neurons, or most neural
pro-genitors). Each Cre line is first being characterized by crossing to a
Rosa26-lsl-TdTomato reporter line to assess cell-type specific expression. The role of VRAC
in cell swelling is being evaluated in each transgenic line by recording real-time confocal
volume responses of astrocytes and neurons in acute mouse hippocampal slices using two
common models of tissue swelling - application of 40% hypoosmolar aCSF or elevated-potassium
aCSF (10.5 mM). In complementary experiments, the impact of VRAC ablation on neuronal
excitability is being measured by recording AMPA and NMDA receptor mediated EPSCs and action
potential generation in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Preliminary data suggest that the ablation of
VRAC does not produce significant changes in the swelling profiles of astrocytes, with
neurons still yet to be measured. However, despite lack of major effects on astrocyte
volume, swelling-induced neuronal activity was moderately impacted in astrocyte-targeted Cre
lines. Neurons from VRAC cKO slices exhibited fewer slow inward currents in response to
swelling in comparison to controls. Furthermore, to complement direct cell swelling models,
we found that application of the pro-epileptic drug 4-AP resulted in less ictal activity in
astrocyte VRAC cKO slices compared to controls. Overall our findings thus far suggest that
astrocytic VRAC may play key roles in mediating excitability under both physiological and
patho-logical conditions..

Amyloid beta is a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the mechanism
of Aβ neurotoxicity is not fully understood. Exosomes associate with Aβ, but it is not clear
how this association would affect Aβ neurotoxicity. We report that the sphingolipid ceramide
mediates neurotoxicity of Aβ. We show that sera from AD transgenic mouse model (5xFAD) and
AD patients, but not the WT or healthy controls, contain a subpopulation of
astrocyte-derived exosomes that are enriched with ceramide and are prone to aggregation
(termed astrosomes) as confirmed by nanoparticle tracking and cluster analyses. Upon being
taken up by Neuro2A cells and human iPS cell-derived neurons, these astrosomes are shuttled
to mitochondria where they induce mitochondria clustering, evident by elevation of
expression of the fission protein dynamin related pro-tein1 (Drp1). Using proximity ligation
assays, we show that Aβ forms a complex with voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDA1), a
protein that functions as gatekeeper for the entry and exit of mito-chondrial metabolites
and is key player in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Complex formation colocalized with
ceramide cotrans-ported with Aβ by astrosomes. The interaction between Aβ and VDAC1 leads to
caspase3 activation and subsequently apoptosis. Aβ-associated astrosomes, but not Aβ alone,
induced neurite frag-mentation and neuronal cell death, suggesting that association with
astrosomes substantially enhances Aβ neurotoxicity in AD. Interestingly, the novel ceramide
analog N-oleoyl serinol (S18) prevented the aggregation of exosomes, and Aβ association with
astrosomes, and reduced Aβ interaction with VDAC1, indicating that exosomal ceramide
mediated binding of Aβ to astrosomes and mitochondrial damage. Our data suggests that
association of Aβ with ceramide in astrosomes enhances Aβ interaction with VDAC1 and
mediates Aβ neurotoxicity in AD, which can be prevented by novel ceramide analogs. This work

Antibodies are critical tools throughout every aspect of Alz-heimer's disease (AD)
including research, diagnostics, and therapy. Additionally, antibodies provide the only
clues for the existence of various conformational species in tissue specimens from humans or
mouse models. One important target of antibodies in AD is the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), the
primary component of senile plaques in the brain and the initial trigger for AD onset. Aβ,
particularly Aβ42, is prone to aggregation, forming a variety of soluble and insoluble
conformational species during the process. Our studies show that one soluble aggregated
species, termed protofibrils, significantly interacts with microglia and is highly
proinflammatory. Due to the importance of this Aβ42 species, we developed an antibody termed
AbSL that selectively recognizes protofibrils over other Aβ forms. Immunization of rabbits
with isolated Aβ42 protofibrils generated a high-titer antiserum with a high affinity and a
strong selectivity for Aβ42 protofibrils over Aβ42 monomers and fibrils. AbSL did not react
with amyloid precursor protein and recognized distinct patho-logical features in AD
transgenic mouse brain slices. The serum was affinity-purified over an Aβ42 protofibril
column to yield apAbSL and a monoclonal form of AbSL (mAbSL) was developed, cloned,
sequenced, expressed and purified. Both apAbSL and mAbSL anti-bodies were integrated into
numerous ELISA formats that are sensitive and selective for Aβ42 protofibrils. Initial
experiments using both antibody competition and mass spectrometry techniques identified a
conformational epitope on protofibrils that involved both the N-and C-terminal domains of
Aβ42 in the pro-tofibril structure. Additional studies demonstrated a sub-stoichiometric
inhibitory effect of mAbSL on Aβ42 aggregation dynamics. By targeting protofibrils, the AbSL
antibody may have potential diagnostic and therapeutic uses in AD tissue and patients..

ENDOLYSOSOME FERROUS IRON ENHANCES MITOCHONDRIAL REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES,
FRAGMENTATION, AND DYSFUNCTION
.

Sciences, Grand Forks, USA

Endosomes and lysosomes (endolysosomes) are acidic organelles that are important both
physiologically and pathologically. Implicated in the physiological and pathophysiological
processes are readily releasable stores of cations including ferrous iron (Fe2+);
an essential cofactor for various enzymes and the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Because of the physiological and pathological relevance of Fe2+ in
generating ROS via the Fenton reaction and because intra-mitochondrial iron originates from
endocytosed ferric iron, it was important to specifically quantitate [Fe2+] in
endo-lysosomes and explore the extent to which and mechanisms by which endolysosome iron is
an upstream event of mitochondrial ROS generation, fragmentation, and dysfunction. First,
using U87MG astro-cytoma cells and primary rat neurons, we determined the fluo-rescence dye
FeRhoNox-1 was specific for Fe2+, that FeRhoNox-1 colocalized to endolysosomes,
and levels of endolysosome [Fe2+] were 36.6±13.6 µM under normal conditions;
[Fe2+] increased to 75±15.7 µM in cells treated with ferric ammonium citrate
(FAC), and decreased to 0.08±0.05 µM in cells treated with the endolysosome-specific iron
chelator deferoxamine (DFO). In control cells, 68% of endolysosomes contained
[Fe2+] ranging from 0 to 50 µM while 32% contained [Fe2+] ranging
from 51 to 150 µM. In FAC treated cells, 32% contained [Fe2+] between 0 to 50 µM
and in DFO treated cells 100% contained [Fe2+] between 0 to 50 µM. Second, we
found endo-lysosome de-acidification with bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) or chloroquine (CQ)
increased released iron from endolysosomes, which resulted in increased iron in the cytosol
and in mitochondria. Baf A1 and CQ increased ROS levels in the cytosol and mito-chondria,
which DFO blocked. We demonstrated endolysosome-resident two-pore channels released iron
from endolysosomes, and mitochondrial permeability transition pores regulated iron uptake
in-to mitochondria. Third, mitochondrial fragmentation was increased by CQ, which DFO
blocked. Our findings suggest endolysosome iron release is an upstream event, sufficient to
increase mitochondrial ROS, fragmentation and dysfunction, and chelating endolysosome iron
might alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction that appears to play important roles in the
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. (Supported by P30GM103329, R01MH100972,

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive
loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). In addition to midbrain
dopaminergic nigrostriatal degeneration in PD, cell damage in extra-nigral sites such as
spinal cord (SC) motor neurons has been observed. The mechanisms of this degenerative
process in both brain and SC remain elusive, although inflammation is believed to be a
common factor involved in many neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. The infiltration of
inflammatory T cells, activation of microglia/astrocytes, and detrimental factors produced
by these cells may be responsible for degeneration and disease progression in PD. Calpain, a
calcium activated cysteine protease, plays a pivotal role in SN and SC (spinal cord)
degeneration in PD; its role in α-synuclein aggregation, activation of microglia, and T cell
migration/activation suggest calpain may be critical in promoting the inflammatory process
and disease progression. While calpain-1 cleavage of α-synuclein promotes synuclein
aggregation in PD and PD-like diseases, the precise involvement of the two major calpain
isoforms, calpain-1 and calpain-2, in α-synuclein processing and immune activation in PD
remains poorly understood. Studies in our lab identified a subtype of CD4+ T cells in MPTP
(1- methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) mice, which was abolished by calpain
inhibitor administration, suggesting activation of calpain plays a role in CD4+ T cell
activation in PD. siRNA-mediated knockdown of calpain-2 inhibited activation of CD4+ T cells
in vitro, indicating distinct calpain isoforms may be involved in the regulation of CD4+ T
cells in PD. Importantly, the previously noted upregulation of CD4+ T cell subpopulation was
markedly attenuated following calpain inhibition in MPTP mice, suggesting that calpain
activation and generation of distinct CD4+ T cell subset(s) may have critical roles in the
inflammatory and neuro-degenerative processes in PD..

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in adult humans that promotes significant
motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunction. However, there is no efficacious therapy
to prevent post-stroke brain damage and neurologic deficits. Recent studies showed that
modulating specific microRNAs (miRNAs) leads to neuroprotection and better functional
recovery after stroke in rodents. As the reagents like miRNA mimics and antagomiRs are
available to rapidly increase or decrease the levels of a specific miRNA, they became
attractive targets for stroke therapeutic development. We pre-sently identified that miR-21
levels increase in a sustained manner when cerebral ischemic tolerance was induced in adult
rodents. As bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-21 targets several pro-apoptotic and
pro-inflammatory molecules that are known mediators of ischemic brain damage, we tested the
efficacy of a miR-21 mimic to protect post-stroke mouse brain. Intracerebral injection of a
miR- 21 mimic in adult mice increased the cerebral levels of miR-21 by >60 fold that
sustained up to 2 days without any signs of toxicity. Treatment with miR-21 mimic induced
significant neuroprotection (smaller infarcts by ∼56%) and motor function recovery compared
to control mimic treatment in both male and female mice subjected to focal ischemia by
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. The miR-21 mimic treated mice didn't show any
change in the rCBF before, during or after MCAO. The miR-21 mimic treatment also
significantly decreased infarct volume and motor dysfunction in aged male and female mice
compared to corresponding age/sex matched control mimic treated cohorts. Treatment with
miR-21 mimic intra-venously at 30 min of reperfusion decreased the post-ischemic infarct
volume and prevented splenic atrophy. In addition, IV miR-21 mimic treatment prevented the
post-ischemic induction of several pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory genes. Thus, these
studies indicate the therapeutic potential of miR-21 after focal cerebral ischemia..

Postnatal neurodevelopment is profoundly influenced by environmental experiences.
Environmental enrichment is a commonly used experimental paradigm that has uncovered
numerous examples of experience-dependent plasticity in health and disease. However, the
role of environmental enrichment in normal development, especially glial development, is
largely unexplored. Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming glia in the central nervous system,
provide metabolic support to axons and establish efficient saltatory conduction by producing
myelin. Indeed, alterations in myelin are strongly correlated with sensory, cognitive, and
motor function. The timing of developmental myelination is uniquely positioned to be
influenced by environmental stimuli, as peak mye-lination occurs postnatally and continues
into adulthood. To determine if developmental myelination is impacted by environmental
experience, mice were housed in an enriched environment during peak myelination through
early adulthood. Using translating ribosome affinity purification, oligodendrocyte specific
RNAs were isolated from subcortical white matter at various post-natal ages. RNA-sequencing
revealed that differences in the oligo-dendrocyte translatome were predominantly evident
after prolonged and continuous environmental enrichment. These translational changes
corresponded with altered oligodendrocyte lineage cell dynamics and enhanced myelination.
Furthermore, consistent with increased developmental myelination, enriched mice displayed
enhanced motor coordination on a beam walking task. These findings indicate that protracted
environmental stimulation is sufficient to modulate developmental myelination and to promote
behavioral function..

Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy complicated syndrome that affects multiple organs
including the brain that continue post-delivery in both mother and the offspring. We
evaluated the expression of oligodendrocytes in the brain of PE rat model through
development as well as the cognitive changes and other behavioural modifications that may
occur later in the life of offspring of PE-like rat model. Pregnant rats divided into
early-onset and late-onset groups were administered with N □ -nitro-L-arginine methyl
(L-NAME) through drinking water at gestational days (GD) 8-17. Rats were
allowed free access to water throughout the pregnancy. At GD 19, post-natal day (PND) 1 and
60, rats were sacrificed and brain excised for further analysis. The offspring were
subjected to behavioural studies for cognitive and sensorimotor impairments before
sacrificed at PND 60. Results showed significant down-regulation in the expression of OLIG2
in PE at GD 19 brain which persists till PND 60. Likewise, there was a significant increase
in the latency to locate the platform in Morris water maze, time to traverse the balance
beam and reduced hanging time on the wire test between the control and the PE treated. PE
could lead to impaired neuronal signalling through demyelination which may contributes
significantly to long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficit..

Astrocytes are positioned between neurons and blood vessels with fine processes that oppose
synapses and endfeet that enwrap the vasculature. This localization allows astrocytes to
participate in several aspects of brain homeostasis, including glutamate clearance, but it
also permits neurons and endothelia to influence astrocyte biology. Astrocytes express two
subtypes of glutamate transporters. The expression of one of these transporters, GLT1/EAAT2,
increases dramatically during synaptogenesis, providing a surrogate marker of astrocyte
maturation. We and others have demonstrated that astro-cytes cultured alone express little
or no GLT1 and that co-culturing with neurons or endothelia induces expression of GLT1 in
astrocytes. While several signaling pathways have been implicated in neuron-dependent
induction, we previously showed that Notch is required for the effect of endothelia. Our
research has two goals: 1) determine which components of Notch signaling mediate the effect
of endo-thelia, and 2) determine how neurons and endothelia synergistically affect the
transcriptome of astrocytes. To address the first goal, we cultured
cortical astrocytes in the presence or absence of the mouse endothelioma cell line bEND.3.
Using recombinant Notch ligands, neutralizing antibodies, and shRNAs directed against Notch
ligands in bEND.3 cells, we found that both delta-like Notch ligands, DLL1 and DLL4, are
involved in endothelial-dependent induction of GLT1. Our studies also showed that astrocytes
increase expression of DLL4 in endothelia. This now published study showed that reciprocal
communication between astrocytes and endothelia contributed to the maturation of both cells
(Martinez-Lozada & Robinson Neurochem Int 2020). To address the
second goal, we cultured cortical astrocytes alone or in the
presence of bEND.3 or rat cortical neurons, or both. We isolated astrocytes using
fluorescence-activated cell sorting and performed RNA-seq and bioinformatic analysis. We
found that neurons and endothelia have both complementary/additive and competitive effects
on the astrocyte transcriptome. Overall, our study indicates that astrocytes receive an
intricate combination of signals from neurons and endothelial cells which ultimately dictate
astrocyte biology..

IL-1 REPROGRAMMING OF ADULT NSC LIMITS NEUROCOGNITIVE RECOVERY AFTER VIRAL
ENCEPHALITIS BY MAINTAINING A PROINFLAMMATORY STATE

Innate immune responses to emerging RNA viruses are increasingly recognized as having
significant contributions to neurologic sequelae, especially memory disorders. Using a
recovery model of West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis, we show that, while macro-phages
deliver the antiviral and anti-neurogenic cytokine IL-1β during acute infection; viral
recovery is associated with continued astrocyte inflammasome-mediated production of
inflammatory levels of IL-1β, which is maintained by hippocampal astrogenesis via IL- 1R1
signaling in neural stem cells (NSC). Accordingly, aberrant astrogenesis is prevented in the
absence of IL-1 signaling in NSC, indicating that only newly generated astrocytes exert
neurotoxic effects, preventing synapse repair and promoting spatial learning deficits.
Ex vivo evaluation of IL-1β-treated adult hippocampal NSC revealed the
upregulation of developmental differentiation pathways that derail adult neurogenesis in
favor of astrogenesis, following viral infection. We conclude that NSC-specific IL-1
signaling within the hippocampus during viral encephalitis prevents synapse recovery and
promotes spatial learning defects via altered fates of NSC progeny that maintain
inflammation..

MODELS.

The complement (C’) system, a critical component of the innate immune system, is activated
in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. It has previously been demonstrated
that genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of the classical C’ initiator, C1q,
provides protection from gliosis and neuronal loss in animal models of AD. To determine if
deletion of C1q alters the gut microbiome and thereby possibly contributes to changes in
disease progression, we assessed the microbiome of the Arctic mouse model of AD using a
tamoxifen-inducible knockout of C1q. WT and Arctic C1qaFL/FL mice containing the
RosaCreERT2 transgene were treated with tamoxifen or vehicle at 6 months of
age, and housed according to treatment. Fecal samples were collected at 12-12.5 months and
subjected to microbial focused Illumina sequencing. C1q deficiency (C1q-iKO) was confirmed
by western blot. Deletion of C1q significantly increased alpha diversity in Arctic animals
compared to their WT counterpart. Beta-diversity, as calculated by Bray-Curtis
dissimilarities, indicated significant variation between WT and Arctic C1q-iKO animals, with
a trend in variation between Arctic animals with and without C1q. Alistipes
and Turicibacter were identified by random forest analysis as two genera
that were critical for distinguishing the four groups..

Alistipes was significantly increased in C1q-iKO Arctic animals compared
to Arctic. A trending increase was observed in C1q-iKO animals compared to C1q sufficient
WT. No significant differences were observed in Turicibacter. However, Arc
C1q-iKO mice displayed a trending decrease in Turicibacter levels compared
to Arctic animals. Both Alistipes and Turicibacter have
the potential to negatively impact gut serotonin levels..

Overall, this study demonstrates that C1q-iKO increases alpha diversity and greater
diversity of the microbial communities in the context of AD like pathology. C1q deletion
particularly affected serotonin regulating bacteria in Arctic animals. Future studies will
assess cognitive function to determine if C1q-induced alterations to the gut microbiome may
influence memory. Finally, these observations provide a foundation for assessing the impact
of C1q on gut microbiome that may affect outcomes in mouse models of disease..

Objectives. The striatum (STR) is the main integrative component of the basal
ganglia (BG) with only few efferent projections targeting mainly the pallidum (GP), the
entopeduncular nucleus (ENT) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). The current
model of the BG relies on the segregation of striatal efferent projections into a direct and
indirect pathway, originating respectively from GABAergic striatal neurons expressing D1
dopamine receptor, substance P (SP) and dynorphin (DYN) and projecting to the SNr and the
ENT (direct pathway), and striatal neurons expressing D2 and enkephalin (ENK) and projecting
to the GP (indirect pathway). Previous single-axon tracing studies in rats and monkeys have
shown that most striatal neurons possess an axon that arborizes into all striatal targets,
suggesting that striatal efferent projections are not as segregated as previously thought.
Here, we present data that support this hypothesis by showing peptide distribution within D1
and D2 striatal neurons. We aim to provide single-axon reconstructions of D1 and D2 striatal
neurons in mice and assess neuropeptide (SP, DYN, ENK) distribution within their axons..

Methods. In vivo injections of cre-dependent AAV were
performed in the striatum of DRD1-cre and DRD2-cre transgenic mice. Immunohistochemical
staining for SP, DYN and ENK allowed to visualize peptide distribution within infected
neurons by using confocal microscopy..

Results. At the time of submission, experiments are still being conducted.
Preliminary data has been acquired showing ENK, SP and DYN distribution within D1 and D2
infected axons, in all striatal targets..

Conclusion. Our preliminary data supports the hypothesis that the D1 and D2
striatal neurons carry GABA and different neuropeptides along their axons and arborize into
all striatal targets, in which they differentially release peptides. Combined with
single-axon reconstructions of D1 and D2 infected neurons, we aim to characterize the
complex axonal trafficking of neuropeptide in the collateralized axons of striatofugal
neurons..

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurologic disorder causing dementia in an increasingly aging
population. Recent evidence shows that the limbic system, critical to the regulation of
emotional behaviors like motivation, reward, or anxiety, is early affected in AD
progression, where the presence of intracellular Amyloid Beta (iAß) has been reported. The
Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) is a central area of the mesolimbic system and is particularly
affected in humans and animal transgenic mice models with AD, however, the effects that iAß
could have in the medium spiny neuron (MSN) of the NAc have not been explored. It is
recognized that synaptic plasticity mediated by long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
depression (LTD), are mechanisms that control complex behaviors like memory, learning, and
reward, being particularly affected in neurodegenerative diseases like AD, however, the
possibility that iAß could inhibit LTD in MSN neurons of the NAc is largely unknown. In this
work we characterize the iAß effects on LTD of MSN neurons of wild type mice brain slices
through a electrophysiologic spike time-dependent plasticity protocol (STDP), and we found
that iAß inhibit LTD without affecting neurotransmitter release probability. In addition,
iAß increased the total post-synaptic event frequency and interestingly, the events
amplitude was increased after LTD induction. These results bring new information about the
effects of iAß on the plasticity of limbic areas like NAc to help to understand the early
changes in AD like anhedonia, motivation, and memory..

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain pervasive even with increased
efficacy and use of antiretroviral therapies, and opiate use/abuse among HIV+ individuals
has been documented to exacerbate CNS deficits. White matter (WM) alterations, including
myelin pallor, and volume and structural alterations detected by diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI), are a common observation in HIV+ individuals. A study using non-human primates
infected with simian immunodeficiency virus suggests that WM may actually harbor latent
virus, since antiretroviral treatment reduced levels of viral DNA in grey matter but not in
WM (Perez et al, J. Neurovirology, 2018). Using a transgenic mouse that expresses the HIV-1
Tat protein, we examined in vivo effects of Tat and opiates (morphine) on WM, at times
ranging from 2-6 wk co-exposure using genomic, biochemical, and morphological methods. After
6 wk chronic exposure, significant differences were observed in multiple myelin basic
protein (MBP) isoforms. Outcomes were region-specific (hippocampus, striatum, corpus
callosum, pre-frontal cortex), and included both individual and interactive effects. For
example, HIV Tat exposure increased levels of the 18.5 kDa MBP isoform in hippo-campus but
not striatum; both HIV Tat and morphine affected 21.5 kDa isoform levels in striatum;
morphine interaction mitigated the effects of Tat on MBP levels in hippocampus and
pre-frontal cortex, but not striatum. RNA sequencing of striatal tissue revealed several
candidate genes associated with oligodendrocyte precursor populations and myelin integrity
that may be related to WM pathology, including transferrin, atypical oligodendrocyte markers
GPR17 and NDRG1, and the oligodendrocyte transcription factor Myrf. Myrf is implicated in
numerous neurological disorders, and is critical for proper oligodendrocyte differentiation
and maturation. Western blot analyses identified regional differences in the effect of Tat
and morphine on Myrf protein levels, some of which coincided with changes in Myrf
transcriptional targets MBP and MAG. Support: DA044939..

Recombinant human IgM22(rHIgM22) binds to myelin and oligo-dendrocytes(OLs) and promotes
remyelination in mouse models of multiple sclerosis(MS). However, the target antigen and the
signaling mechanisms through which rHIgM22 exerts its function are still unclear..

In vitro analysis revealed that rIHgM22 binds to sulfatide, but also to
phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid. Moreover, the composition of
the lipid microenvironment of its antigen can modulate the affinity of the antibody,
suggesting that reorganization of lipid membrane might be relevant in its biological
activity..

In rat mixed glial cells(MGC), rHIgM22 causes an increase in the levels of PDGFαR and
induces a dose-dependent proliferative response in all the cells in the culture, with the
most significant response associated with astrocytes. Moreover, rHIgM22 increases the
production and release of sphingosine 1-phosphate(S1P) in MGC while total levels of ceramide
remain unchanged. Furthermore, release of S1P is strongly reduced by a selective inhibitor
of PDGFαR. Increased S1P production is not mediated by regulation of sphingosine kinase 1
and 2, instead, we observe a significant reduction of S1P lyase. Remarkably, rHIgM22
treatment does not induce changes in the production and/or release of S1P in astrocytes, but
it increases its release in BV2 cells, suggesting that rHIgM22 indirectly influences the
proliferation of astrocytes in MGCs, by affecting ceramide/S1P balance..

Analysis of the effect of rHIgM22 on glycosphingolipid metabolism in MGC and astrocytes
revealed no significant effects on the lipid pattern, while in OPCs and OLs we observe an
increase in the levels of different gangliosides, known for their ability to interact with
and modulate the activity of different growth factor receptors..

Considering all this, we propose that rHIgM22 protective effects might be mediated by
alterations of lipid-dependent membrane organization and/or signalling in different cell
types present in the nice of MS lesions and that a complex cross talk between different cell
types is underlying the ultimate repair effect elicited by this antibody..

Objectives: Segmental demyelination consistently occurs in patients with
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type-4J (CMT4J) caused by recessive mutations in
FIG4 gene. Our previous study has demonxstrated an increased
intracellular Ca2+ in FIG4 deficient Schwann cells due to lysosomal
Ca2+ channel dysfunction. In this study, we tested a hypothesis that whether
FIG4 deficient Schwann cells are sensitized to demyelinate upon the challenge of extra
Ca2+..

Methods: Surgically exposed sciatic nerve in 3-month-old Fig4
f/f
 and Schwann cell conditional knockout
(scFig4−/− ) mice was wrapped by gauze
soaked with 10µM Ca2+ Ionophore A23187, while the contralateral sciatic nerve was
treated with vehicle for 3 hours. The mice were allowed to recover for 10 days, followed by
nerve conduction studies and teased nerve fiber analysis for counting segmental
demyelination..

Results: A23187 significantly decreased conduction velocity (CV) in
scFig4
−/− nerves, compared with that in vehicle-treated scFig4
−/−nerves (A23187 8.8±0.8 m/s vs. vehicle 13.4±3.0 m/s;
p<0.01, n=5 for each group). A23187 did not affect CV in
Fig4
f/f nerves (A23187 30.0±3.2 m/s vs. vehicle 28.8±4.0 m/s;
p>0.05; n=5). Segmental demyelination was observed in 9.0±1.1% of nerve
fibers from scFig4
−/− nerves treated with A23187, 2.2±0.2% in scFig4
−/−nerves treated with vehicle, 2.3±0.4% in Fig4
f/f nerves treated with A23187, and or 2.0±0.6% in Fig4
f/f nerves treated with vehicle (p<0.01, 100-200 fibers
counted/mouse, n=5 mice for each group). Segmental demyelination was associated with an
increase of Schwann cell dedifferentiation factor c-Jun level..

Conclusions: FIG4-deficiency impairs the capacity of Schwann cells to “buffer”
extra Ca2+, thereby sensitizing the cells to demyelination..

In a live animal, the extra Ca2+ in Schwann cells could be induced by axon
excitation or cytokines released from macrophages..

Small molecules that promote the formation of new myelinating oligodendrocytes from
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are potential therapeutics for demyelinating
diseases. We recently established inhibition of specific cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes
and resulting accumulation of 8,9-unsaturated sterols as a unifying mechanism through which
many such molecules act. To identify more potent sterol enhancers of oligodendrocyte
formation, we synthesized a collection of 8,9-unsaturated sterol derivatives and found that
24,25-epoxylanosterol potently promoted oligodendrocyte formation. In OPCs,
24,25-epoxylanosterol was metabolized to 24,25-epoxycholesterol via the epoxycholesterol
shunt pathway. Increasing flux through the epoxycholesterol shunt using genetic manipulation
or small-molecule inhibition of lanosterol synthase (LSS) increased endogenous
24,25-epoxycholesterol levels and OPC differentiation. Notably, exogenously supplied
24,25-epoxycholes-terol promoted oligodendrocyte formation despite lacking an 8,9-
unsaturation. This work highlights epoxycholesterol shunt usage, controlled by inhibitors of
LSS, as a target to promote oligodendro-cyte formation. Additionally, sterols beyond the
8,9-unsaturated sterols, including 24,25-epoxycholesterol, drive oligodendrocyte
formation..

ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR: A NOVEL GLAST REGULATOR
.

Cinvestav, Toxicology, Mexico City, Mexico

Glutamate (Glu) is the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the Central Nervous System of
mammals, exerts its effects by activating specific membrane receptors present in neurons and
glia cells. Extracellular Glu levels are tightly regulated by a family of high-affinity
sodium-dependent transporters known as excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT), which
remove Glu from the synaptic cleft, internalizing it to mostly to glial cells. When Glu is
inefficiently removed, a phenomenon of neuronal death can occur due to the over activation
of Glu receptors, it is known as excito-toxicity. Glu glial transporters are essential for
glutamatergic neuro-transmission and to avoid excitotoxicity, and a deficiency in the
expression of transporters can lead to the development of pathologies such as Alzheimer's
disease, among others. Glu transporters are regulated at several levels, including
transcription of their gene, mRNA stability and maturation, post-translational modifications
and mem-brane traffic. In this work, we focused in the transcriptional regulation of the
slc1a3 gene. Using the well-characterized in vitro model
of chick cerebellar Bergmann glial cells in which only the EAAT1 / GLAST transporter is
expressed, we describe here the effect of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)
exposure in GLAST function and expression levels. Bioinformatic analysis of the
chglast promoter revealed the presence of xenobiotic response (XRE) DNA
binding sites. A time and dose dependent increase in GLAST activity and protein levels was
found suggesting a new element that regulates slc1A3 expression. These
results strengthen the notion of the pivotal role of glia cells in the regulation of
glutamatergic signaling..

DARS2-related leukodystrophy, also called Leukoencephalopathy with
Brainstem and Spinal cord involvement and Lactate elevation (LBSL), is a rare disorder
characterized by childhood-onset of slowly progressive spasticity, cerebellar ataxia, and
dorsal column dysfunction with wide-ranging severity. Infantile-onset patients with rapid
neurological deterioration, and adulthood-onset oligosymptomatic cases have also been
reported. LBSL is caused by mutations in DARS2, which encodes the
mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme which charges aspartate to its cognate
tRNA. Almost all patients are compound heterozygotes for DARS2 mutations,
most of which carry a missense mutation on one allele and a splice-site mutation in intron 2
on the other allele leading to exon 3 exclusion and a frameshift. Considering the exclusive
complexity of pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms in human, conditional knockout of
Dars2 in mice does not address the contributions of specific variants;
however, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have opened a new platform
to investigate pathology in disease-relevant cells. IncuCyte live cell imaging reveals
significant developmental differences between control and LBSL patient iPSC differentiated
motor neurons (iMNs) and microelectrode arrays (MEA) show decreased electrical activity of
LBSL iMNs throughout differentiation. Due to the high occurrence of intron 2 mutations, much
focus has been placed on understanding the effects of increased production of mRNAs lacking
exon 3. Human splicing software illustrates intronic splicing silencers (ISSs) at the end of
intron 2 are relatively stronger than exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in exon 3, making the
3’ splice-site of exon 3 naturally weak. We verified by RT-qPCR that abnormally spliced
transcripts exist in control iPSCs and iMNs and that the relative expression of aberrant
transcripts increased in LBSL in a cell-type specific manner. Careful modeling and
understanding of pathogenic variants will facilitate the testing of potential therapeutics,
such as antisenseoligonucleotides (ASOs), which show promises to correct the exon 3 splicing
pattern in LBSL..

UNDERSTANDING THE GENETIC REGULATION OF NEURONAL PLASTICITY WITHIN THE MATURE RAT
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

The decline in neuronal plasticity within the mature mammalian central nervous system
following injury is a well-known phenomenon that has yet to be elucidated. Our study
utilizes the magnocellular neurosecretory system which is comprised of magnocellular neurons
(MCN) of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) that produce and transport oxytocin and vasopressin
along their axonal projections to the posterior pituitary for secretion into the
bloodstream. In young rats (35 days), this system possesses an in-trinsic property for
axonal regeneration following unilateral lesion of MCN axons that occurs within the
contralateral uninjured SON. However, in mature rats (125 days), this capacity for
regeneration is lost. Our study aims to identify key transcriptome and epigenome alterations
that occur during aging to explain this loss in neuro-regeneration. In uninjured rats, we
observed key changes in the transcriptome of the mature rat SON, including genes involved in
the inhibition of axonal guidance and activation of immune system pathways. Furthermore, we
observed a reduction in genes of key neurotrophic factors such as BDNF within our mature
group. These data may suggest a mechanism for the age-related loss of axonal regeneration.
We anticipate that such changes in gene expression will correlate to changes in DNA
methylation and chromatin remodeling. Identifying these alterations that occur within our
uninjured aging model will provide a fundamental baseline to assess our future findings
within the axotomized SON..

Microglia as the main resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) have
critical, underappreciated roles in development and in the maintenance of brain homeostasis.
Microglia also become highly reactive throughout the course of all neurological disease
including multiple sclerosis. To gain a clear insight into the role of microglia in CNS
pathology we first need to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying development of
these cells..

Furthermore, it has been shown that animal model organisms consistently fail to mimic human
physiological conditions. In the present study, we performed whole, single-cell RNA
sequencing on 13,568 microglia isolated from surgical samples of second trimester fetal,
pediatric (18 months to 2 years old), adolescent (10 to 14 years old) and adult (40 to 62
years old) brains. Using Seurat (v3) package to analyze the data we showed there are
multiple subtypes of micro-glia during human development contributing to a continuum genes
expression. We showed fetal microglia have a distinct transcriptomic expression profile
compared to all post-natal samples. Based on the transcriptional signatures we predict fetal
cells to have a higher phagocytic capacity than microglia from other ages while postnatal
microglia have a greater proinflammatory gene signature and this increases with age.
Moreover, we revealed the adolescent derived microglia were transcriptionally distinct from
pediatric and adult cells, and they exhibited the most metabolically active transcriptomic
profile. Finally, we correlated our findings about human microglia with mouse microglia
datasets from the literature and observe that in spite of high correlation between human and
mouse, microglia samples cluster according to their species and not according to
developmental age. To understand the diverse function of human microglia during disease we
must first gain insight into the gene expression programs that underlie each stage of normal
development. This study is a valuable resource to explore transcriptional changes of human
microglia during development at the single cell level..

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Recent work in the
field identified volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs), as important players in
progression of several cancers. The current study tested the role of VRAC in GBM cell
proliferation by targeting the essential subunit of this channel, leucine-rich
repeat-containing family 8 member A (LRRC8A). First, we analyzed the abundance of VRAC
components, LRRC8A-E, using a qRT-PCR approach. Four out of five LRRC8 gene products,
LRRC8A-D, were highly expressed in GBM tissue. Among LRRC8 isoforms, LRRC8A was upregulated
up to 18-fold in 16 out 18 GBM tissue samples as compared to non-malignant brain tissue
(commercial sources). Similar expression patterns were observed in primary GBM cell
cultures: up to 25-fold upregulation compared to primary human astrocytes (commercial
sources). Functional expression of VRAC in primary GBM cells was validated with a
radiotracer assay, and its role in cell proliferation probed by an RNAi approach. siRNA
knockdown of LRRC8A reduced cell growth by up to 60% in two primary GBM cell lines, as
established by MTT assay and DAPI counting of adherent cells. Parallel LDH release
measurements showed no evidence for increased cell death suggesting an effect on
proliferation. The detailed FACS analysis of siRNA-treated cells did not reveal significant
distortions in cell cycle progression. Western blot examination of cyclins and
cyclin-dependent kinases did not identify consistent changes in cyclin-dependent machinery.
In the ongoing work, we are exploring alternative mechanisms of LRRC8A knockdown on GBM cell
growth. Overall, this work links LRRC8A-containing heteromeric VRAC to the proliferative
potential of the primary brain tumor GBM. Targeting VRAC may be utilized as a new treatment
modality..

Thyroid hormone (TH) plays an important role in the development of the central nervous
system. In particular, TH signaling is critical for the differentiation of oligodendrocyte
precursor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes, which myelinate the CNS. Although gene
regulations by TH and TH receptors have been well-studied, it is still not clear how TH
initiates cell cycle exit in dividing OPCs. Previous work from our laboratory revealed that
intracellular redox status is a central regulator of the balance between self-renewal and
cell-cycle exit in dividing OPCs. Here, we report a critical role of hyper-activation of the
c-Cbl tumor suppressor protein, via the redox-Fyn-c-Cbl (RFC) pathway, in inducing cell
cycle exit of OPCs in response to TH. The effects of TH were prevented by knockdown of
either Fyn kinase or c-Cbl, and also by preventing TH-induced increases in OPC oxidation.
Moreover, these effects of TH are not mediated by classical TH receptors. We also found that
other O-2A/OPC differentiation signals, including TGF-beta 1 and BMP4, converge on requiring
ROS generation and activation of the RFC pathway to cause O-2A/OPC cell cycle exit. Taken
together, our studies provide a new molecular pathway by which multiple distinct signaling
molecules regulate O-2A/OPC cell cycle exit by convergence on ROS-mediated RFC pathway
activation..

Mutations in the X-linked CASK gene in human have been associated with
microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (MICPCH) in heterozygous girls and
epileptic encephalopathies in hemizygous boys. The precise molecular cause of this pathology
is uncertain but interactions between CASK protein and the Tbr1- Reelin pathway have been
implicated. Herein, we first present an autopsy of a boy hemizygous for an early truncation
mutation of the CASK gene resulting in no functional protein production.
Gross and fine histopathological analysis reveals severely diminished cerebellar volume;
however no defect in lamination, neuronal differentiation, or migration is observed,
precluding the role of the Tbr1-Reelin pathway in cerebellar pathology. Interestingly,
molecular analysis reveals an upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein
immuno-staining, indicating reactive astrogliosis common in neuro-degenerative disorders.
This led us to hypothesize a degenerative, rather than a developmental cause for the
observed diminishment of cerebellar volume. Further investigating this in a murine model, we
utilize a Calb2 driven Cre recombinase to delete Cask from
the majority of cerebellar neurons. Ablation of CASK from post-migratory neurons of the
cerebellum results in otherwise normal cerebellar development, lamination, and function up
to approximately post-natal day 45 when degeneration begins to be observed. The properly
developed cerebellum degenerates over several weeks to result in profound diminishment in
volume and culminates in severe motor ataxia. We propose that the underlying etiology of
MICPCH resultant from CASK-loss is degenerative rather than developmental and that this may
extend to other X-linked disorders such as Rett Syndrome. Random X-chromosome inactivation
results in 50% of cells in heterozygous girls having functional CASK and a plateau of
cerebellar degeneration while hemizygous boys with no CASK continue to degenerate..

Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with impaired formation or function
of perisomatic inhibitory synapses formed by fast-spiking, Parvalbumin-expressing
interneurons. Collagen XIX, a brain-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) protein associated
with familial schizophrenia, contributes to the assembly of these same perisomatic
inhibitory synapses. Proteolytic processing of ECM proteins in vivo leads to the release of
bio-activie peptides known as matricryptins. In the case of Collagen XIX, such enzymatic
processing leads to the shedding of a non-collagenous peptide (NC1 [XIX]) that is sufficient
to trigger inhibitory synaptogenesis in vitro. Here, we investigated whether intracortical
administration of NC1 [XIX] impacts the assembly of inhibitory perisomatic synapses in vivo.
Synthetic NC1 [XIX] or control peptides were injected intra-cortically into one hemisphere
of wild-type or Col19a1-/- mutant mice (which exhibit reduced perisomatic inhibitory
synapses). Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate synaptic architecture and sites,
including antibodies against synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) which selectively label inhibitory
synapses. In line with in vitro studies, we found that NC1 significantly increased the
distribution of Syt2+ inhibitory nerve terminals in wild type mice and rescued the loss of
inhibitory synapses seen in Col19a1-/- mutant mice. These data reinforce the link Collagen
XIX and inhibitory synaptogenesis and suggests that administration of this matricryptin may
have thera-peutic potential..

Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus linked to neurological
complications and memory impairment in the adult clinical population. In an adult mouse
infection model, ZIKV pre-ferentially targets the hippocampus, a brain region essential for
proper memory formation. In conjunction with these data, there is mounting evidence that
ZIKV infection is not simply a transient infection in adult humans but rather induces a new,
emerging syndrome: Zika virus-associated cognitive impairment. Virologic control of ZIKV
within the central nervous system (CNS) is contingent upon proper host-viral interaction and
CD8+ T cell during acute encephalitis. Only recently has it been established
that antiviral CD8+ T cell populations remain in the CNS for prolonged periods of
time following clearance of neurotropic viral infections. These long-lived memory T cells
are termed tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) and provide enhanced protection against
reinfection. However, unbalanced local cytokine responses or re-activation of T cell
populations can have serious negative cognitive consequences. To date, comprehensive
analyses of specific T cell subset populations in the CNS after ZIKV infection and their
functional implications in ZIKV-related cognitive impairment have not been performed. In the
present study, we assessed CD8+ T cell populations after recovery from ZIKV infection by
flow cytometry and correlated with outcomes on the Barnes Maze spatial memory task. Results
showed ZIKV specific CD8+ T cell populations in poor learners are skewed to a
CD103− /CD69+ phenotype rather than
CD103+/CD69+ as seen in good learners within the hippocampus after
recovery. Data also suggest that within the hippocampus of poor learners, APCs have
in-creased expression of B7 co-stimulatory molecules while CD8+ T cells have reduced
inhibitory (PD-1, CTLA-4) molecules. These data suggest functional implications of
CD8+ T cell interactions with local APC populations in ZIKV-related cognitive
impairment post recovery..

The study was aimed at evaluating the attenuating effects of Quercetin on Lead-induced
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and in-terleukin-1β (IL-1β) neuroinflammatory responses and
histopathology of the hippocampus and cerebellar cortex of Wistar rats. Thirty male Wistar
rats of average weight of 119.00g were randomly divided into 6 groups (each, n=5). Groups I
and II were administered distilled water (H2O: 1 ml/kg) and Lead (Pb: 125mg/kg),
respectively for 42 days. Lead (Pb: 125mg/kg) was co-administered with quercetin (Q:
60 mg/kg) and Succimer (S: 10 mg/ kg) for Groups III and VI, respectively for 42 days.
Groups IV and V were administered lead (Pb: 125 mg/kg) for 21 days and treated with Q:
60 mg/kg for Groups IV and S: 10 mg/kg for Group V for 21 days. The administrations were
orally, once per day and lasted for 42 days. At the end of administrations, the rats were
anaesthetized with Ketamine at 75mg/kg intraperitoneally and euthanized. The skull was
opened, brain was harvested, weighed and divided into two halves. One half was used for
histological slides and the other half was minced and homogenized in cold phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4). The homogenates were centrifuged and the supernatant were obtained and used for
the assessment of TNF-α and IL-1β. The results show that lead significantly increased the
level of TNF-α and IL-1β in brain (p<0.05) and induced histopathology such as vacuolation
and pyknotic of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellar cortex of lead exposed rats.
However, there were significant decreased in TNF-α and IL 1β and changes in histopathology
of rats exposed to lead and treatment with quercetin (p<0.05). It was concluded that
quercetin could be of importance in treatment and prevention against neuroin-flammation..

Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that perinatal infections and other maternal immune
challenges during pregnancy increase the risk of offspring developing neurodevelopmental
disorders that include schizophrenia, autism (ASD), ADHD, Tourette disorder, depression,
cerebral palsy and bipolar disorder. Animal and epidemi-ological studies point to the
importance of inflammatory cytokines in inducing these behavioral changes. Notably,
interleukin-6 (IL-6) injected mid-gestation can cross the placenta and the fetal blood-brain
barrier, reaching the fetal CSF and reproducing behavioral deficits of MIA models. We have
shown previously that IL-6 can directly affect neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural
progenitors (NPs) of the subventricular and subgranular zones. Here, we have injected IL-6
into mouse pups twice daily, from P3 to P6, at a dose of 75 ng per injection, to increase
IL-6 plasma levels 2-fold. This elicited a subtle but significant increase in body
temperature that persisted for 2 months and was more prominent in males than females but had
no effect on overall growth. Postnatal IL-6 treatment elicited behavior changes reminiscent
of important symptoms in neurodevelopmental disorders. At 3 weeks of age, IL-6 injected male
mice showed reduced nose-to-nose and urogenital sniffing during reciprocal juvenile play. At
6 weeks, the IL-6 injected mice were less social, as assessed by both social approach and
novel social subject tests. As adults, these animals produced fewer ultrasonic vocalizations
and showed reduced interaction (urogenital sniffing) during mating. Additionally, IL-6
injected male and female mice exhibited increased self-grooming and males had an increase in
fear conditioning in the inhibitory avoidance task. At the cellular level, IL-6 stimulated
the proliferation of a multipotential progenitor and decreased the pro-liferation of two
glial restricted progenitors. Fate mapping studies revealed decreased neurogenesis in the
dorsal hippocampus, reduced astrogliogenesis in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala and
decreased oligodendrogenesis in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum. Altogether,
these studies provide new insights into the biological mechanisms that contribute to complex
neurodevelopmental brain disorders. Supported by a grant from the Governor's Council for

Craniotomy is a neurosurgical procedure required to gain access to the brain for tumor
resection or epilepsy treatment. Infectious complications occur at a frequency of 1-3%, with
approximately half caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S.
aureus) that forms a biofilm on the bone flap. Our recent scRNA-seq study
revealed the transcriptional heterogeneity of infiltrating leukocyte populations during
S. aureus craniotomy infection, which included T cells and NKT cells. In
the current study, intracellular cytokine staining revealed an equivalent number of Th1 and
Th17 cells infiltrating the brain at days 7 and 14 post-infection, suggesting that T cells
may influence inflammatory responses during S. aureus craniotomy infection.
Bacterial burden in the brain, subcutaneous galea, and bone flap was significantly higher in
RAG1 knockout (KO) compared to wild type (WT) mice at days 3, 7, and 14 post-infection,
suggesting a critical role for T cells in infection containment. This was supported by
findings in IFN-γR KO mice, where S. aureus titers were significantly
elevated out to day 28 post-infection. The similar phenotypes of IFN- γR and RAG1 KO mice
suggested that T cells are critical for regulating the antibacterial properties of other
leukocyte and microglial subsets. To investigate this possibility, we utilized a sc-RNAseq
approach, which confirmed the progressive increase in T cell recruitment into the brain
during the course of infection. Hallmark pathway analysis identified a significant increase
in hypoxia-and glycolysis-associated genes in the brain of RAG1 KO mice, particularly in
granulocytes and microglia, with a concomitant decrease in Type I and II Interferon
responsive genes (ISG, IRF, IFIT, GBP etc.). These results are suggestive of T cell
crosstalk with other immune cell populations in the brain by altering their activation and
metabolic states. Collectively, these findings reveal the importance of adaptive immunity in
dictating the outcome of craniotomy infection by regulating the activity of infiltrating
granulocytes and resident microglia..

The cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein and corresponding extracellular release of
various amyloid-β (Aβ) species is a key feature of early stage Alzheimers disease (AD). It
is well established that elevated neuronal activity increases release of soluble Aβ;
however, a fundamental question regarding this process remains: does activity drive
aggregation? The hippocampus has both a high degree of neuronal activity and is an early
site of amyloid plaque pathology. Soluble and insoluble Aβ pathology spreads along specific
neuronal networks in both mice and humans, such as the perforant pathway connecting the
entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus. Sustained increase in excitatory synaptic strength,
i.e. long-term potentiation (LTP), is impaired in the AD hippocampus. We hypo-thesize that a
threshold of neuronal activity exists in which monomeric release of Aβ reaches a
pro-aggregative level. Using a novel micro-immunoelectrode (MIE) allows for detection of Aβ
species every 60 seconds for approximately three hours in vivo, or in living acute brain
slices. MIEs utilize an antibody-attached electrode to measure the oxidation of tyrosine
residues, such as those in human Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ dimers. The amount
of current detected is proportional to the concentration of target molecule present. By
altering the degree of excitation in acute brain slices and measuring the release of
amyloid, kinetics can be defined on a more precise time scale. Greater understanding of
these processes may enable interventions aimed at homeostatic control of hyperexcitability
for prevention of the formation and spread of Aβ and downstream pathologies..

At present, patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and other neuro-degenerative diseases
suffer from disease progression without any satisfying clinical intervention. The
aggregation and accumulation of neurotoxic alpha-synuclein (aSyn) and loss of dopaminergic
neurons are the major pathological hallmarks of PD. Thus, to effectively treat PD, it is
necessary to eliminate cytotoxic aSyn and sustain the function of dopaminergic neurons. We
harness the bioactivity of ganglio-sides, abundant in the nervous tissues and critically
important in brain functional development. Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing
glycosphingolipids and capable of interacting with aSyn with high affinity to stabilize an
alpha-helical state and inhibit fibrillation and aggregation. Ganglioside expression
profiles are known to be associated with pathogenic mechanisms in many neurological
disorders. Deficiency in major brain type gangliosides (including GM1) are particularly
noticeable in the brain of PD patients. In this study, intra-nasal spray of ganglioside GD3
and GM1 could reduce aSyn level and restore functional dopaminergic neurons in an A53T
aSyn-overexpressing mouse (PD mouse). Furthermore, intranasal infusion of GM1 significantly
enhanced expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra pars compacta of
the PD mouse, following the restorations of the expression and nuclear localization of,
Nurr1 (also known as NR4A2), a dopaminergic neuron-associated transcription factor. GM1
induces activation of the TH gene transcription, including augmentation of
acetylated histones and recruitment of Nurr1 to the TH promoter region. In
this way, GM1 epigenetically regulates dopaminergic neuron specific gene expression. Our
present study demonstrates that intranasal administration of gangliosides could effectively
reduce neurotoxic proteins and restore functional neurons via modulating chromatin status by
nuclear gangliosides. In further studies, we will apply curative gangliosides to restore
functional neurons in other similar neuro-degenerative diseases that result from
accumulation of misfolded toxic proteins (e.g., Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases).
Since many of these age-related neurodegenerative diseases affect an increasing number of
patients, our research will benefit millions of senior citizens, their families and world
society..

Examination of 66 brain samples with a modified proteomics protocol revealed a striking
increase in the isomerization of tau for both sporadic and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's
disease (AD, ADAD) relative to controls. Importantly, roughly half of the control group
exhibited high levels of amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology, yet
isomerization of tau was statistically indistinguishable in these samples from clean
controls. Further analysis revealed that tau isomerization is greater in ADAD when compared
to sporadic AD. We hypothesize that autophagic flux in AD/ADAD brains is lower than that
found in healthy controls. Additional data strongly support this hypothesis, including
quantitative analysis of protein abundance showing that isomerization of tau positively
correlates with levels of p62, a recognized indicator of autophagic inhibition. Furthermore,
other proteins involved in autophagy were found to be in lower abundance in AD samples
relative to controls. In conclusion, the data reveal that isomerization of tau is strongly
connected with AD status and suggest strong ties between isomerization and autophagic flux,
which may therefore represent a promising target for future investigations into the therapy
and prevention of AD..

Many recent studies have investigated the role of insulin resistance in cognitive
dysfunction and Alzheimer type of dementia. The transcription factor peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonists and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have
been accounted as neuroprotective. Hence in this study we have focused to evaluate the
efficacy of brain targeted poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) based
nanoparticle of rosiglitazone (PPAR-γ agnost) and vorinostat (HDACi) in neuro-protection
along with its effect on various genes implicated in memory and cognition..

Mice model of Alzheimer's type of dementia was developed with intra-hippocampal injection
of beta-amyloid1-42. The PEG-PCL based nanoparticle of rosiglitazone (5 mg/kg)
and vorinostat (25 mg/kg) was prepared by emulsion-diffusion-solvent evaporation method
further the nanoparticles were linked with TAT peptide. The nano-particle and free drug
combination were administered for 28 days. Neuroprotective effect of rosiglitazone and
vorinostat was assessed by evaluating the expression of genes which are implicated in
cognitive function, such as CREB, BDNF, GDNF and NGF with respect to internal control gene
by RT-PCR method, the behavioral parameters was assessed by Morris water maze test and
neuronal degeneration was estimated by histochemical analysis..

We found that combination of rosiglitazone and vorinostat up-regulated the mRNA expression
of CREB, BDNF, GDNF, NGF with respect to internal control. However the nanoformulation
markedly up regulated the mRNA expression than that of its free form. Further, the
behavioral study and the histochemical analysis revealed significant improvement on
cognitive deficits and neuronal degeneration after nanoformulation treatment..

In view of our study outcomes it is concluded that rosiglitazone and vorinostat in its
nanoformulation have efficiently attenuated the cognitive deficits and neuronal degeneration
in beta-amyloid induced mice model of Alzheimer type of dementia along with up-regulation of
genes implicated for memory..

Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are a unique sub class of GPCRs; each aGPCR
possesses a large extracellular region that contains various domains potentially involved in
cell-cell and/or cell-matrix adhesion in addition to the classical 7-transmembrane (7TM)
region that is involved in cell signaling. aGPCRs represent the second largest GPCR family,
but remain significantly understudied; however, mounting evidence demonstrates that aGPCRs
are critical regulators of nervous system development and repair. We previously demonstrated
that one such receptor, ADGRG1 (previously Gpr56), plays important roles in central and
peripheral nervous system myelin development and maintenance [Ackerman et
al., 2015, 2018; Giera et al., 2015, 2018]. In
the peripheral nervous system (PNS), global Adgrg1 knockout mice develop
various defects during development and adulthood including radial sorting defects, defects
in myelin ultrastructure and domain organization, and progressive neuropathy-like symptoms
with age. It is unclear if Adgrg1 functions in Schwann cells, axons, or both cell types;
thus, it is critical to investigate cell type-specific functions of ADGRG1. To this end, we
have generated Schwann cell and sensory neuron specific conditional knock out mouse lines of
Adgrg1 (Adgrg1
Floxed
; P0
Cre
 and Adgrg1
Floxed

Schwann cells and sensory neurons. Our ongoing efforts to dissect cell-specific functions
and to investigate possible ligands for ADGRG1 in the PNS will be discussed..

Glutamate (Glu) is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS)
and exerts its actions by activating specific plasma membrane receptors and transporters.
Under physiological conditions, extracellular levels of glutamate are regulated by a family
of sodium-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT). Most of glutamate uptake is
carried out by glia glutamate transporters in order to recycle this neurotransmitter through
the so-called glutamate/glutamine shuttle. Exposure to environmental pollutants such as
methylmercury (MeHg), has been linked to cognitive deficits in children. Taking into
consideration that MeHg readily permeates the blood brain barrier (BBB) and that glia cells
outnumber neurons and their end feet is part of the the referred barrier, in this
contribution we explored the effect a MeHg acute exposure in the functional expression of
GLAST. To this end, we used the established model of chick cerebellar Bergmann glia
cultures. A substantial increase of [3H]-D-aspartate (used as a non-metabolizable glutamate
analog) uptake was present upon the exposure of the cultured cells to non-cytotoxic
nanomolar MeHg concentrations. These results suggest that MeHg neurotoxicity has been
underestimated and provide a biochemical support to the reduction in the World Health
Organization (WHO) permissive exposure limit..

To investigate the functional organization of Myelin Basic Protein (Mbp)
regulatory sequence, we mutated Mbp enhancers and derived 7
different mouse lines. These mutants demonstrate stable, variably reduced or augmented
Mbp mRNA accumulation1. As MBP is necessary and limiting for
CNS myelin formation and maintenance2,3,4, such mice demonstrate a range of
stable hypomyelination thus providing opportunities to investigate MBP functions during
myelin sheath formation and secondary changes arising from CNS hypomyelination. Axons of
appropriate diameter are ensheathed, albeit with thin myelin, but in one line, myelinated
fibres demonstrate anomalous profiles while small to medium caliber axons remain
amyelinated. Secondary consequences extend to myelin proteins and lipids and an altered
density and state of multiple glial populations. The MBP Hypomyelination
Consortium hopes that the characterization of the models reported here will
facilitate their application to diverse questions in myelin biology. 1: Bagheri et

COMPARISON OF COGNITIVE, SENSORY AND MOTOR FUNCTION BETWEEN WILD-TYPE AND SYSTEM
XC-NULL MICE

Alterations in Excitatory/Inhibitory (E/I) balance contribute to the pathobiology of
neurological diseases (e.g. stroke, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury) and
neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. autism and schizophrenia) all of which are associated
with cognitive and motor impairments. Recent evidence from our lab demonstrates that loss of
the heterodimeric plasma membrane amino acid cystine/glutamate antiporter, system
x− (Sx−), leads to E/I imbalance..

Specifically, we find that both male and female Sxc− null mice
(SLC7a11sut/sut C3H/HeSnJ) have a reduction in their convulsive seizure
threshold upon acute systemic administration of the chemo-convulsant kainate, as compared to
their wild-type littermates (SLC7A11+/+ C3H/HeSnJ). Whether this shift towards
excitation is accompanied by cognitive, sensory, and/or motor behavioral deficits remains
unknown. To determine this, we compared 8-9 week old male and female
SLC7a11sut/sut mice with their age-and sex-matched SLC7A11+/+
littermates using the accelerating rotor-rod to test motor strength/coordination and motor
learning as well as pre-pulse Inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, a measure
of sensorimotor gating theorized to contribute to cognitive organization. With respect to
rotor-rod, there was no statistical genotypic difference between male or female
SLC7A11+/+ (n=13M,16F) and SLC7a11sut/sut (n=18M,10F) mice with
respect to motor coordination or motor learning. Specifically, the latencies to fall on
acceleration of the rod did not differ nor did the increase in time to fall demonstrated
over 4 days of testing performed every other day [two-way repeated measures ANOVA].
Likewise, pre-pulse inhibition was similar between male SLC7A11+/+ and
SLC7a11sut/sut (n=8/genotype; two-way repeated measures ANOVA), indicating that
mice null for system xc− had no deficit in sensorimotor gating.
Despite this, the acoustic startle amplitude of male SLC7a11sut/sutmice was
statistically higher than that of their sex-matched SLC7A11+/+ littermates
(two-tailed t-test, p<0.0413). Analysis of females is on-going. Since, E/I balance
regulates the threshold of startle responses, the shift toward excitation by the system
xc− mutation may explain this enhancement of startle. Supported by

The extent to which NG2+cells contribute to glial and fibrotic scar formation
after spinal cord injury (SCI) is poorly understood. To selectively ablate dividing
NG2+ cells responding to SCI, we utilized a novel transgenic mouse line in
which cells expressing NG2 also express a thymidine kinase from herpes simplex virus (NG2-tk
mice). Intraventricular administration of antiviral agent ganciclovier (GCV) causes
apoptosis in dividing NG2+cells (including oligodendrocyte progenitors and
pericytes). Immediately following unilateral white matter-specific C5 SCI in NG2-tk mice, a
drug delivery pump was placed subcutaneously with attached catheter inserted into the
ventricle to administer GCV or saline for 14 days. Our prior work showed ablation of
NG2+ cells significantly altered density and distribution of glial and fibrotic
scars through 21d post-injury. Compared to controls, these alterations prolonged hemorrhage,
enhanced edema, and impaired forelimb recovery, but also increased axons entering the lesion
area (Hesp et al., 2018). The present study assessed long-term consequences of acute
NG2+cell ablation. Drug pumps were removed after 14 days, allowing a recovery
period before assessment at six-or eight-weeks post-SCI. In contrast to earlier time points,
overall density of GFAP in the glial scar and laminin within the fibrotic scar did not
significantly differ between NG2+ cell-ablated and non-ablated mice. However,
there were differences in scar density and patterning, suggesting altered recovery after GCV
cessation. A unique pattern emerged in the gray matter adjacent to the lesion, with
significantly increased laminin profiles resembling blood vessels in NG2+
cell-ablated mice at both time points. Consistent with acute findings, more axonal profiles
were maintained within lesions in GCV-treated mice. Iimpaired motor recovery also persisted
through 8w post-injury. Clarifying the roles of NG2+ oligodendrocyte progenitors versus
pericytes will be important to further define the contributions of each cell type to
beneficial and deleterious cellular responses to CNS injury..

THE ROLE OF NOS3 EXPRESSION IN MICROGLIA RESPONSE DURING ISCHEMIA IN WHITE
MATTER
.

Hung Nguyen, Selva Baltan.


Oregon Health & Science University, Anesthesiology & Perioperative Medicine,
PORTLAND, USA
.

White matter (WM) damage after ischemic injury contributes significantly to neurological
impairments. In grey matter, microglia play a dual function after ischemic injury:
exacerbating injury through pro-inflammatory markers and promoting neuroprotection. Nitric
oxide synthase (NOS) activation contributes to oxidative damage in ischemia. The expression
of NOS isoforms in WM is cell-specific and age-dependent. Particularly, microglia express
NOS3 in young WM, but both NOS2 and NOS3 isoforms in aging WM. Inhibition of NOS3 exerts
functional protection against ischemia in young and aging axons. However, whether this
protective effect is mediated through microglial activation has not been investigated. We
hypothesize that ischemic injury alters microglial activity and morphology in WM, and that
NOS3 inhibition preserves microglial activity and function, which contribute to axonal
protection against ischemic injury..

We used isolated Cx3Cr1-GFP mouse optic nerves (MONs), a pure WM tract, to visualize and
quantify the morphological changes of GFP (+) microglia in a model of in
vitro ischemia. Confocal live imaging of green fluorescent microglia was captured
and quantified at baseline and during 1h of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) with or without
L-NIO, a NOS3 inhibitor. In males, OGD altered ∼90% of microglial dynamics as quantified by
a series of morphological parameters, including the complexity of processes, size, shape,
and area covered by microglia. Application of L-NIO attenuated the percentage of microglial
changes to ∼25%. Interestingly, in females OGD caused alterations in only ∼43% of microglia,
and application of L-NIO did not improve these changes..

Our results show that microglia in WM undergo significant morphological changes during
ischemia, but the percentage of microglia that responds to ischemia is higher in males
compared to females. Subsequently, NOS3 inhibition attenuated responsive microglia more in
males. This study raises the question of how microglial activation participates in ischemic
injury and axon function recovery in male vs. female WM, and whether NOS isoform expression
in microglia of male and female WM regulates axon function recovery..

In the era of antiretroviral therapies, secondary hypogonadism remains a common problem
among young and middle-aged HIV-1- infected men (∼25%) and its prevalence increases with
age. In the U.S, ∼51% of HIV-infected individuals are 50 years of age or older. Although the
underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, HIV-1 proteins, such as the trans-activator of
transcription (Tat), may contribute to hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunction
partly via the promotion of mitochondrial toxicity and disrupted steroidogenesis. In this
study, we hypothesized that conditional Tat expression in middle-aged male transgenic mice
[Tat(+)] would promote cognitive impairment, affective-like and neuromuscular dysfunction,
and mechanical allodynia, compared to age-matched controls [Tat(-)]. We further expected
that Tat expression would alter the steroid hormone milieu resulting in abnormalities that
would correlate with behavioral deficits. Age and/or Tat exposure altered steroid hormones
wherein middle-aged Tat(+) mice exhibited greater circulating corticosterone, lower
circulating testosterone (T), and increased allopregnanolone in the midbrain and
hippocampus. In young adults, Tat exposure accelerated the progesterone increase observed in
middle-age and also increased circulating estradiol (E2) and the E2:T
ratio. Older age or Tat exposure increased anxiety-like behavior in an open field and an
elevated plus-maze, increased numbers of radial arm water maze errors, and reduced grip
strength compared to young adult and Tat(-) males. Young adult Tat(+) or middle-aged Tat(-)
males had higher mechanical nociceptive thresholds than their age-matched counterparts.
Levels of several steroids (corticosterone, allopregnanolone, and testosterone) correlated
with behavioral endpoints. Thus, HIV-1 Tat appears to be sufficient to amplify age-related
disease states..

Blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) represents a majority of military-related
neurotrauma. We report provisional insights into mechanisms of low-intensity blast
(LIB)-induced patho-biology and long-term neurobehavioral deficits in mice, using the
military-relevant “Missouri Blast” model with open-field detonation of
high-energy explosive C4 (350 grams). We report effects to date of incident and ground
reflected shockwaves, generating a static peak overpressure of 46.7 kPa, with maximal
impulse of 60 kPa x ms at 3- m distance from 1-m above ground detonation. Transmission
electron microscopy delineated LIB effects at the ultrastructural level for the neuron
perikaryon, axons, and synapses of mice at 7- and 30-days post-injury (DPI). A significant
increase of PSD95 and synaptophysin protein levels 7 DPI suggest potential synaptic
reorganization. Alternation of vGluTs, EAATs, and glutamine synthetase expression indicate
dysregulated glutamate transmission due to circuit excitability. Blast-exposed mice
demonstrated significantly decreased contact duration in Social Interaction test and
increased anxiety-like activity in Open Field test 3 months after LIB exposure, suggesting
delayed effects of mTBI simulating blast-related human behavior. These results indicate
single LIB exposure causes ultrastructural brain injury, accompanied with multi-focal
subcellular alterations and long-term behavioral deficits. The “Missouri
Blast” model provides a useful paradigm, elucidating pathogenic mechanisms of
primary blast exposures in the absence of head impact or acceleration. Support:

Multiple sclerosis (MS) characteristically presents as a relapsing and remitting disease.
There are several factors that can signal onset or progression of symptoms, notably
including seizures. MS patients are three to six times more likely to develop epileptic
seizures and seizure incidence can indicate sudden and severe onset and progression. Despite
this, demyelination-associated seizures and hyper-excitability are poorly understood. To
address this, we aim to determine the spatial and temporal anatomy of EEG changes following
chronic demyelination and assess cellular markers in identified regions of seizure activity.
Male mice were subjected to a normal or 12-week cuprizone (CPZ) diet in order to induce
chronic demyelination. These same animals were implanted with planar 30- contact
multi-electrode arrays (MEA) and monitored for spontaneous electrographic seizure activity.
The left temporal and left frontal cortices demonstrated synchronized seizure activity in
12-week CPZ animals. We then assessed neuronal activation, inhibitory networks and glial
involvement in these left temporal and prefrontal cortex using immunohistochemistry to
determine whether changes in cell population and circuitry were correlated with epileptic
hyperactivity. Chronically demyelinated animals demonstrated increased astrogliosis and
c-fos activation in areas of seizure activity. Additionally, while parvalbumin neuron
populations were decreased in the cortex, the existing parvalbumin neurons showed increased
fiber projection, suggestive of cortical remodeling. Our data suggests that increased
cellular activity and alterations in inhibitory and glialnetworks may be associated with
demyelination-associated seizures. By understanding how these inhibitory and excitatory
networks change in response to demyelination, we can better understand seizure generation in
MS..

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-delimited particles which are fundamental
for intercellular communication. EVs capacity for biologic information transfer makes them
an attractive tool as therapeutic agents for nanodelivery of different molecules to target
cells. They are able to cross the blood brain barrier, their structure is biocompatible, and
the cargo is protected from degradation, which increases molecule stability, solubility and
bio-availability..

Previous work by our group has shown the pro-differentiating effects of apoTransferrin
(aTf) on oligodendroglial cells in vivo and in vitro. The remyelinating effect of aTf was
also observed in a model of hypoxia/ischemia where aTf was intranasally administered. In
this scenario, the purpose of this work is to establish the effect of nano-particles loaded
with human aTf in a model of demyelination induced by cuprizone (CPZ)..

EVs were isolated from mouse plasma and characterized by Western blot, dynamic light
scattering and scanning electron microscopy. Isolated EVs containing the Tf receptor 1
(TfR1) were loaded with aTf, specifically through binding to TfR1, using two passive
cargo-loading strategies which rendered EV-Tf loaded particles. In this work, we show the
promaturation effect of the EV-Tf system on oligodendroglial primary cultures and its
remyelinating effect through intranasal administration in CPZ-demyelinated mice, as assessed
through different cell markers and myelin staining..

These results show EVs as potential nanovehicles of aTf to be delivered into the CNS
parenchyma and pave the way for further studies into their possible clinical application in
the treatment of demyelinating diseases..

Though peripheral neuropathies normally refer to weakness of the extremities, respiratory
complications have also been documented in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and
Dejerine-Sottas disease (DSS) patients. Heterozygous Trembler J (TrJ) mice are an
established model of severe hereditary demyelinating neuropathies as they carry the same
Leu16Pro mutation in PMP22 which is found in DSS patients. Our previous studies of 2-9 month
old TrJ mice indicate severe phrenic nerve degeneration with significant demye-lination, and
a concurrent hypertrophy of diaphragm muscle fibers. To investigate the underlying mechanism
for this unexpected phenotype, we performed immunohistochemistry and biochemical analyses of
diaphragm tissues from 5-9 month male and female Wt and TrJ mice. Immunolabeling with
anti-actinin antibodies showed intact Z-lines in affected diaphragms from 2 month old mice,
suggesting the preservation of functional contractile units at this age. Western blot
analyses of whole diaphragm tissue lysates demonstrated significant (p<0.01) upregulation
of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and an increase in the autophagy marker LC3II.
Immuno-histochemistry on frozen diaphragm tissue sections confirmed the biochemical results,
as samples from neuropathic mice displayed increased reactivity with antibodies against
ubiquitin and the lysosomal membrane protein 1 (LAMP1). As a follow up to the phrenic nerve
degeneration, we also examined spinal cord cross sections from vertebrae C3-C5 of 4-month
old male and female Wt and TrJ mice. Double immunolabeling with cell type specific markers
indicated astrogliosis in samples from TrJ mice. Atypical neurofilament whirls were also
seen in occasional ventral motor neurons, demonstrating ongoing CNS pathology in phrenic
neuropathy. Together, our results indicate pathological degenerative events in both PNS and
CNS of neuropathic mice, co-occurring with adaptive changes in the diaphragm. Further
investigation of the respiratory complications in neuropathic rodent models will contribute
towards identifying the appropriate tissue targets to improve human patient quality of
life..

VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION RESCUES ABERRANT NF-KB PATHWAY ACTIVATION AND AMELIORATES
RETT SYNDROME NEURONAL MORPHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR
.

Mayara Ribeiro, Jessica MacDonald.


Syracuse University, Biology, Syracuse, USA

Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked, severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations
in the transcriptional regulator MECP2. Previous research found that in the
absence of Mecp2, NF-kB signaling is increased in the CNS of mice.
Genetically attenuating the aberrant NF-kB activation ameliorates several hallmark
phenotypes of RTT, including neuronal morphology, identifying the NF-kB pathway as a
potential therapeutic target for RTT. Among the known inhibitors of NF-kB signaling is
vitamin D (VitD). Interestingly, VitD deficiency is prevalent in RTT patients, and we have
found that male Mecp2-null mice have significantly lower serum levels of
VitD (25(OH)D). Thus, we aimed to investigate whether VitD supplementation can reduce NF-kB
signaling and improve RTT phenotypes. We find that VitD lowers NF-kB activity and promotes
neurite outgrowth of Mecp2-knockdown cortical neurons in
vitro. To investigate whether VitD has therapeutic benefit in
vivo, we placed Mecp2-null male and Mecp2
heterozygous female (Mecp2+/-) mice, and their wildtype littermates, on
custom chow containing 1IU/g (control), 10IU/g, or 50IU/g VitD at 4 weeks of age. Both
Mecp2- null male and heterozygous female mice on the supplemented diet
display increased dendritic complexity and soma area when compared to Mecp2
mutant mice on the control chow at symptomatic ages, 4 and 20 weeks of age, respectively.
Additionally, Mecp2+/- mice on 10IU/g VitD supplementation demonstrate
improved motor coordination and decreased anxiety-like behavior compared to
Mecp2+/- mice on control 1IU/g VitD. To investigate how VitD ameliorates
RTT phenotypes, we performed RNA-seq analysis on total cortex of a subset of female mice
that underwent behavior assays. We identified over 200 genes that are differentially
expressed in Mecp2+/- mice, compared to wildtype, on 1IU/g VitD but that
are no longer significantly different in Mecp2+/- mice on 10IU/g VitD.
These rescued differentially expressed genes are involved, among other things, in neuronal
morphology, and thus could underpin the behavioral and morphological rescue observed with
VitD. Thus, our data indicate that VitD could be a simple and cost-effective partial
therapeutic avenue for RTT..

In the visual system, retinal axons convey visual information from the outside world to
dozens of distinct retinorecipient brain regions. In rodents, two major areas that are
densely innervated by this retinal input are the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN)
and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), both of which reside in the thalamus. The
dLGN is well-studied and known to be important for classical image-forming vision. The vLGN,
on the other hand, is associated with non-image-forming vision and its neurochemistry,
cytoarchitecture, and retinothalamic connectivity all remain unresolved, raising fundamental
questions of its role within the visual system. Here, we sought to shed light on these
important questions by studying the cellular landscape of the vLGN and map its connectivity
with the retina. Using in situ hybridization, immuno-histochemistry,
electrophysiology, and genetic reporter lines, we discovered at least six transcriptionally
distinct subtypes of inhibitory neurons that are distributed into distinct adjacent
sublaminae. Using trans-synaptic viral tracing and in vitro electrophysiology, we found that
cells in each these sublaminae receive direct inputs from retina. Lastly, by genetically
removing this visual input to the vLGN, we found that the organization of these sublaminae
is dramatically disrupted, suggesting a crucial role for sensory input in the
cyto-architectural maintenance of the vLGN. Taken together, these results not only identify
novel subtypes of vLGN cells, but they also point to new means of organizing visual
information into parallel pathways – by anatomically creating distinct sensory channels.
This subtype-specific organization may be key to understanding how the vLGN receives,
processes, and transmits light-derived signals in the subcortical visual system..

16P11.2 DELETION AND GESTATIONAL IRON DEFICIENCY ALTER DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN VENTRAL
FOREBRAIN ORGANOIDS

The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnoses has been rapidly increasing over
the last several decades. Numerous genetic and environmental risk factors for ASD have been
discovered, however it remains unclear how these risk factors interact and converge upon
common developmental pathways to generate aberrant phenotypes. Heterozygous deletion of the
16p11.2 copy number variant is associated with increased risk for ASD diagnosis as well as
iron deficiency anemia, potentially due to a reduction in BolA2, a protein involved in Fe-S
cluster formation. In order to investigate how iron deficiency and 16p11.2 deletion affect
early neurodevelopmental events in a human system, we cultured 16p11.2 deletion
patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, and an Nkx2.1:GFP embryonic stem cell line
to generate ventral forebrain organoids (VFOs). Using immunofluorescence, we have
demonstrated the establishment of cells expressing markers of mature inhibitory neurons, as
well as transcription factors associated with the development of these cell types, which
maintain a spatiotemporal organization which closely models that seen in the developing
human brain. Preliminary results demonstrate that this organization is modulated by iron
deficiency in Nkx2.1:GFP VFOs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that early embryoid bodies
maintain equivalent size across conditions at early timepoints but begin to diverge when
region-specific morphogens are applied, at which point 16p11.2 deletion organoids
demonstrate an overall gross increase in organoid volume. This result contradicts findings
previously reported from animal models of 16p11.2 but is consistent with observations of
macrocephaly in human 16p11.2 deletion patients..

Inhibition sculpts neurophysiological excitability and modulates brain oscillations that
give rise to sensation, perception, and cognition. Inhibitory neurotransmission is largely
mediated by GABAA receptors in mammalian central nervous system. GABAA
receptors are heteropentameric and composed of two α, two β, and a fifth subunit, usually
either δ (less common) or γ2 (most common). Besides releasing GABA to activate
GABAA receptors on projection cells, GABAergic interneurons themselves express
GABAA receptors and receive phasic and tonic inhibition from other
interneurons. Allopregnanolone (AlloP) is a neurosteroid recently approved for treating
postpartum depression in women. Past evidence suggests that AlloP may selectively target
δ-containing GABAA receptors..

Previously, we utilized novel pharmacoresistant GABAA receptor subunits to test
the role of α4δ-containing receptors, a dentate granule cell (DGC) subunit combination, in
mediating AlloP effects. In contrast to more extensively studied DGCs, hippocampal
fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons express an unusual variant partnership
of δ subunits with α1 subunits. Here we hypo-thesized that native α1δ receptors may provide
a strong substrate for AlloP, resulting in potentiation of tonic current. Contrary to the
hypo-thesis, electrophysiology from genetically tagged PV+ interneurons in hippocampal
slices showed that 100 nM AlloP promoted phasic inhibition by increasing the sIPSC decay,
but tonic inhibition was not detectably altered. Co-application of 100 nM AlloP with 5 µM
GABA did result in tonic current augmentation. Our results indicate that AlloP principally
promotes phasic current but may disinhibit in-terneurons through tonic inhibition under
conditions of high ambient GABA. This differs from effects on nearby DGCs in which AlloP
significantly promoted tonic current even in the absence of exogenous ambient GABA..

CELLULAR AND SYNAPTIC THALAMIC ALTERATIONS IN A MOUSE MODEL OF DRAVET SYNDROME
.

Carleigh Studtmann, Sharon Swanger.


Virginia Tech, Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, Roanoke, USA
.

Dravet Syndrome (DS) is an infantile epileptic encephalopathy caused by mutations in the
voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1, which leads to hyperexcitable brain activity
during development. This altered excitability causes persistent dysfunction across brain
circuits, resulting in a broad phenotypic profile including non-convulsive (absence)
seizures, attention deficits, and sleep disruption. Corticothalamic (CT) circuits are
responsible for diverse informa-tional processing and play a particularly important role in
regulating attention and sleep. Disrupted CT circuit activity contributes to a variety of
phenotypes in DS models and thus offers a promising therapeutic target. However, the precise
cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying CT circuit dysfunction remain elusive. Here, we
sought to identify the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying pathological
somatosensory thalamic circuit activity in a DS mouse model, thereby revealing therapeutic
targets to correct circuit function. Electrophysiology results reveal the first evidence of
synaptic-level alterations in the somatosensory thalamus of a DS mouse model, including a
significant reduction in the glutamatergic synaptic input to the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus
and a significant increase in gabaergic input to the same region. Interestingly, synaptic
input to the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (nRT), an inhibitory neuron population that
forms reciprocal connections with the VB, remains unaltered. Furthermore, nRT neuron
intrinsic excitability was altered in this DS mouse model including significant changes in
resting membrane potential and depolarization-induced firing response. These data indicate
that diverse synaptic and cellular-level changes in multiple neuron populations may
contribute to somatosensory thalamic dysfunction in this DS model, providing ample
opportunity for therapeutic intervention..

FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF VALENCE AND VARIANCE IN UBE3A IN THE CONTEXT OF
NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISEASE
.

Kellan Weston, Xiaoyi Gao, Jinghan Zhao, Jason J. Yi.


Washington University in St. Louis, Neuroscience, St. Louis, USA
.

UBE3A is a HECT (homologous to E6AP C-terminus) domain E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets
substrate proteins for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The UBE3A gene
is imprinted exclusively in neurons such that only the maternal allele is expressed. Precise
deletion or null mutation of the maternal copy of UBE3A causes a severe form of intellectual
disability known as Angelman syndrome. In contrast, duplication or triplication of maternal
15q11- 13, the chromosomal location within which UBE3A resides, is linked to a prevalent
syndromic form of autism known as Dup15q syn-drome. This observation suggests that excessive
UBE3A activity may be causative for autism phenotypes in Dup15q syndrome; however, evidence
for this hypothesis remains sparse. In order to identify if precise, hyperactivating
mutations in UBE3A are sufficient to drive disease, we devised a high-throughput assay to
screen the functional consequence of UBE3A missense variants. We screened over 150 variants
and identified distinct functional classes of UBE3A mutants based on their effect on
enzymatic activity. Importantly, we identified over a dozen novel gain-of-function variants
that aberrantly hyperactivate UBE3A enzyme activity. We confirm that UBE3A hyperactivation
is sufficient to drive neurode-velopmental disease phenotypes in humans, and mice carrying a
specific hyperactivating mutation in UBE3A exhibited aberrant motor and communication
defects. Finally, mapping the results of our screen to the UBE3A protein structure revealed
an unknown allosteric regulatory site within the catalytic domain that acts as a
charge-dependent regulator of enzyme activity. Altogether, our study provides conclusive
evidence that bi-directional changes in UBE3A activity are sufficient to cause distinct
neurodevelopmental outcomes, and moreover, sheds new light on the mechanisms that regulate
UBE3A activity..

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is considered as most invasive cancer which accounts for
approximately 54% among different types of brain cancers. It is extremely aggressive, with
poor prognosis and highly resistant to many anticancer drugs. The median overall survival of
only 11 months has been reported in the general GBM population with standard GBM therapies.
GBM relapse is very common and a challenge for its treatment. Therefore, there is dire need
to develop new drug having effective therapeutic potential for GBM. The purpose of the
present study was to evaluate cardiac glycosides on human glioblastoma cells U87. Cardiac
glycosides are present in plants and used for their important medicinal properties. They
have been formerly used as diuretic, abortifacient, emetic and as a heart tonic. Earlier we
have found a potent anticancer activity of these compounds on human oral cancer cell line
cal27. Since GBM is considered as a resistant tumor with low rate of remediation, therefore
we decided to evaluate the activity of these compounds on human U87 cell line. MTT assay was
used to determine the cytotoxic effect of these compounds. The calculated % growth
inhibition revealed a significant inhibition of the U87 cells following the treatment in a
dose dependent manner. Treatment of U87 cells with these compounds was done for 24h. The
IC50 of the compounds was found to be at 17µM and 2µM dose. Reactive oxygen
species were also observed at these IC50 doses. Moreover, wound healing assay was
performed which further evaluated their role as anticancer agents. These observations showed
the potential of these compounds as potent anticancer agents against U87 cells and suggest
further research for the development of anticancer drug using these cardiac glyco-sides for
the treatment of human glioblastoma..

DECIPHERING INFLAMMATORY CHANGES ELICITED BY CRANIOTOMY SURGICAL DAMAGE THAT PROMOTE
STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BIOFILM FORMATION

Craniotomy is a neurosurgical procedure involving the removal and replacement of a skull
fragment (bone flap) to access the brain. Despite precautions, infection occurs at rates of
1-3% with about half due to Staphylococcus aureus forming a biofilm on the
bone flap. Infections carry significant morbidity, often requiring the bone flap to be
discarded concomitant with long-term antibiotic therapy. This study aimed to understand how
the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from tissue following a
craniotomy contributes to biofilm formation and infection persistence. A mouse craniotomy
model was used to compare spatial and temporal attributes after sterile sham surgery vs.
S. aureus infection. Flow cytometry revealed the differential influx of
leukocyte subsets into the brain, subcutaneous galea, and bone flap. Monocytes were the
major leukocyte population recruited to the brain, whereas granulocytic myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) and neutrophils were most numerous in the galea and bone flap.
These patterns were similar for sham and infected mice at three days post-surgery, even in
the presence of significant bacterial burdens (105-106 cfu) suggesting
that surgical damage alone is a major driver of the acute immune response. However, at later
time points (days 7-28) there was a divergence between groups, notably in the galea, where
monocytes were enriched in sham animals but G-MDSCs remained elevated in the infected group.
Quantification of inflammatory mediators revealed significant increases in pro-inflammatory
cyto-kines and chemokines in the brain and galea of infected mice including IL-1β, TNF-α,
IL-6, CXCL9, and CXCL10. As a followup, in vitro metabolic analyses of
microglia co-cultured with live S. aureus biofilm showed preferential
upregulation of oxidative phos-phorylation with minimal change in glycolysis, indicating
that bio-film elicits an anti-inflammatory phenotype supporting infection persistence.
Collectively, these results suggest DAMPs released following craniotomy mask the infection
by inducing a wound healing response promoting biofilm formation. Once formed, the biofilm
can metabolically reprogram microglia leading to its persistence. Supported by the NIH
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (R01NS107369)..

Microglia plays an important role in the neurotoxicity of various xenobiotics, within which
highlights the metals, a clear example is the toxicity caused by manganese. Acute
intoxication with manganese leads to a clinical feature similar to Parkinson's disease. This
condition is called “manganism”. This phenomenon alters the motor
coordination due to an accumulation of manganese in the globus pallidus, an
area that forms part of the basal ganglia. This effect can be observed mainly in people who
are occupationally exposed, for example welders and workers of the steel industry. It should
be noted that all the world population has already been exposed to manganese, since this
metal is present in most of the food consumed, moreover it is also present in the
drinking-water, air, gasoline additives and some other sources. Epidemiological studies
demonstrate the relationship of manganese exposure and cognitive deficits in children. Other
in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that exposure to
different manganese chemical forms, time periods, and concentrations is linked to an
increase in the activation of microglia. In the present study, we assessed the activation of
cerebellar micro-glia in mice exposed to either 100 mg/kg of MnCl2, 5 mg/kg of
lipo-polysaccharide (LPS) or vehicle, via a single intraperitoneal
injection. Twenty-four hours later, the cerebellum was removed and after
extensive washing was cryoprotected and sagittally sectioned with a cryostat. Activated
microglia was evidenced with the iba-1 antibody. A significant increase in activated
microglia was evident in mice treated with LPS and MnCl2. These results suggest
that MnCl2 exposure results in an augmented release of pro-inflammatory
cyto-kines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β) and reactive oxygen species leading to microglia
activation..

degenerative phase of MS. Visual system impairments are evident in MS, presenting a uniquely
accessible system to monitor disease pathology. However, the underlying cellular pathology
driving functional and structural visual assessments and how it relates to deficits in the
rest of the CNS remains ill-defined. The purpose of this study was to explore the
relationship between myelin/axonal injury and neuro-degeneration in the visual system and
spinal cord during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a chronic model of
autoimmune demyelination used for preclinical testing of MS pharmacological therapies.
Histopathological assessments were coupled with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to track
retinal structure and visually evoked potentials (VEP) to monitor neuronal responses to
visual stimuli. Our results show comparable T cell infiltration, demyelination, and axonal
loss 15 days post-induction in spinal cord white matter during peak of motor dysfunction and
optic nerve when VEPs were delayed. Neither spinal cord neuron nor retinal ganglion cell
loss was observed until the chronic phase of disease (35 days post-induction), consistent
with OCT imaging showing thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer. These data suggest a
retrograde degeneration of neuronal cell bodies following damage to their respective axons
in the white matter. In further support, post-synaptic neuronal loss was not observed
anterograde to axonal injury in the spinal cord or visual system (i.e. ventral
posterolateral nucleus or lateral geniculate nucleus, respectively). Our results indicate
that the visual system and spinal cord have similar time courses for demyelination, axonal
injury, and neurodegeneration, and suggest that OCT imaging of the retina may serve as an
important indicator of CNS neurodegeneration..

Depression affects 322 million people worldwide. Chronic stress promotes immune system
dysregulation and recruitment of inflam-matory mediators to the brain promoting depression.
The blood-brain-barrier (BBB) restricts peripheral inflammatory cytokines and immune cells
from the brain, however, its integrity is compromised in depression. Interestingly, most
individuals exposed to stressful events of life remain resilient not developing depression.
Accordingly, stress-resilient mice display intact BBB integrity and low inflammatory profile
when compared to stress-susceptible animals. Physiology of the brain endothelial cells that
line the BBB includes transporters involved in the bidirectional flow of macro-molecules
through this barrier, a mechanism named transcytosis. These transporters maintain BBB
integrity and control transcytosis keeping it at physiological level, a mechanism that could
be disrupted by chronic stress leading to increased passage of inflammatory markers into the
brain. Here, we evaluate stress-induced endothelial cell transporters changes in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) of C57Bl6 mice, an important brain area involved in mood regulation and
hedonic behavior, and its association with peripheral inflammatory marker. Male and female
mice were subjected to 10-day chronic social defeat stress followed by social interaction
test 24h later to determine behavioral phenotype. Then, we evaluated transporters gene
expression by qPCR and protein levels are currently being quantified by immunostaining and
confocal microscopy in the NAc. In addition, we collected mice serum before and after the
stress protocol to evaluate the peripheral inflammatory makers by milliplex assay. We
observed specific gene expression level patterns in stress-susceptible and resilient male
and female mice associated with peripheral inflammatory markers. We are also confirming
validity of our mouse findings in post-mortem tissue from depressed patients which will add
translational value to this research. The BBB is perfectly located to bridge peripheral
immune communication to the brain neuronal circuits. My project sheds new light on the
emotions` biology by deciphering how the peripheral immune system interacts with the brain
neurovasculature to modify neuronal circuits involved in emotional processing..

In most neurodegenerative disorders, including neuroAIDS, reactive astrocytes are
detrimental to the neuronal population. Calcium and its downstream regulators play a central
role in mediating astrocyte reactivity. Coronin 1A, an actin-binding protein, majorly
reported in hematopoietic cells, regulates cell activity in a calcium-dependent manner, but
its role in astrocyte physiology and reactivity is largely unknown. Using a
well-characterized primary culture of human astroglia and neurons, we explored the roles of
Coronin 1A in astrocyte physiology and its involvement in facilitating astrocyte reactivity.
In this study, we report Coronin 1A expression in human primary astrocytes and autopsy brain
sections, and that it plays activity-dependent roles by facilitating Calcium mobilization
from the intracellular stores. HIV-1 Tat, a potent neuro-toxicant that turns astrocytes
reactive, augments Coronin 1A expression, apart from affecting GFAP and pro-inflammatory
mole-cules. Also, the autopsy brain tissue of HIV-1 infected individuals has higher Coronin
1A expression. Downregulation of Coronin 1A attenuated the HIV-1 Tat-induced deleterious
effects of reactive astrocytes, measured as upregulated GFAP expression, enhanced release of
IL-6, and Glutamate and hence reduced astrocyte-mediated neurodegeneration. Our findings
also suggest that out of a pool of dysregulated miRNAs studied by us, hsa-miR-92b-5p
regulates Coronin 1A expression under the effect of HIV-1 Tat. These findings highlight the
novel roles of Coronin 1A in regulating astrocyte activity in stimulated conditions and
astrocyte reactivity observed in HIV-1 neuropathogenesis..

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating, chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder
characterized both motor and non-motor features. In recent past most researches have been
paid attention to autophagy modulation and epigenetic alterations such as histone
acetylation in neuroprotection. Hence in this study we have focused to evaluate the
neuroprotective efficacy of rapamycin, an autophagy inducer and vorinostat, an histone
deacetylase inhibitor in α-syn induced rat model of PD..

PD rat model was developed by unilateral injection preformed fibrillar form (PFF) of α-syn
into striatum. A combination of rapamycin and vorinostat was administered intraperitonealy
for period of 4 weeks at a dose of 0.5 mg/ kg and 25 mg/ kg respectively. Further,
behavioral parameters were assessed by Morris water maze, novel object recognition task and
narrow beam walk test. The bio-chemical estimations for IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α CRP, BDNF and
dopamine level were performed using standard ELISA kits. The level of different genes
involved in autophagy such as BECN1, LC3-II, LAMP-2 were assessed by real time polymerase
chain reaction analysis and the histopathologic examination was done by H&E
staining..

Intra-striatal PFF α-syn administered rat showed significant characteristic features PD.
However, treatment with rapamycin and vorinostat in combination showed significant
improvement in the motor and memory deficits in comparison with disease group and their
treatment in alone. The level of IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α CRP were significantly reduced whereas
level of BECN1, LC3-II, LAMP2, BDNF and dopamine were found increased on combination
treatment than that of its treatment in alone. Further, the histopathologic analysis
revealed marked reduction in neurodegeneartion in combination treated group with respect to
treatment in alone..

Outcomes of the present study indicate that the synergistic action of autophagy induction
by rapamycin and histone deacetyalse inhibition by vorinostat elicits marked neuroprotection
and attenuates motor and cognitive deficits in PFF α-syn induced PD model of rat..

Increasing evidence suggests that the inciting pathogenic events in Alzheimer's disease may
involve disruption of the multicellular interactions within the neurovascular unit. The
interruption of specific molecular pathways within the neurovascular unit occurs antecedent
to classic pathology and therefore is an attractive target to modulate neurodegeneration.
However, the majority of molecular pathways regulating neural and gliovascular signaling
remain unknown. Single-cell and whole tissue gene expression approaches have been used in
various animal models of dementia to discern new pathways but are limited by sequencing
depth and spatiotemporal accuracy of transcriptional profiling. We developed an approach for
identifying relevant and novel pathways within the multicellular environment of the
neurovascular unit interactions in Alzheimer's disease. Cell-specific viral constructs
coding for antigen-tagged ribosomes (TRAP) were used to study variance in spatial and
temporal gene expression patterns within and between cell types in the PS19 (P301S)
transgenic model of tauopathy. The engineered lentiviruses and adeno-associated viruses
express an HA-tagged ribosomal protein (Rpl10a-HA) driven by a cell-type specific promoter
(Synapsin, GFAP, or PDGFRa) for the major cell types of the neurovascular unit. We
demonstrated the ability of the viruses to target specific cell types under particular
spatiotemporal conditions and confirmed cell-specificity in vivo using both
known cell-specific markers and novel markers identified by sequencing. We then combined
this cell-specific vTRAP system with the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy to generate multiple
cell-type specific transcriptomic databases of the neurovascular unit across several
pathologically-relevant time points. Gene ontology analysis indicates a prodromal drive by
gliovascular cells including pericytes and astrocytes to support injured neurons. This
occurs through specific and temporally regulated coordination of multiple molecular programs
driving neuronal differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and synaptogenesis. This suggests a
paradigm for gliovascular rescue of neurodegeneration phenomena and implicates numerous
novel perivascular molecular pathways in the pathogenesis of tauopathy and Alzheimer's
disease..

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is thought to be caused by a combination of multiple genetic and
environmental factors, and the role of infectious agents has been debated for decades. A
recent multiomic, epidemiological study of large Alzheimer patient cohorts revealed a
specific and significant association of human herpesvirus 6A (HHV6A) with AD. However, these
studies could not resolve which HHV6A specific genes were involved or how HHV6A might affect
cells of the central nervous system (CNS) to exacerbate AD. As HHV6A is mainly present in
the brain in its latent form, we asked
the question of whether the major
latency associated gene
U94A, affects host cells
functions that are relevant to Alzheimer disease
pathology Using a human cell system, we found that U94A
expression impairs the migration and maturation of human glial progenitor cells (OPCs) and
leads to synapse loss in human neurons. We present transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of
U94A infected cells that show dysregulation of genes involved in cytoskeletal functions,
myelination and synaptic maturation. These phenotypes are particularly relevant for the
early stages of Alzheimer disease, as mounting evidence suggests that synapse and neurite
loss, associated with diffuse demyelination precede cognitive impairment. This work will
provide insight into the potential role of infectious agents in Alz-heimer's pathology and
will establish that HHV6A viral latency is not merely a benign state of viral infection, but
an important disease modifying factor..

INTRODUCTION: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by brain cells are known
to regulate neuronal and glial function and are emerging as a source of biomarkers for
neurodegenerative diseases due to their presence in blood and pathological cargo. These
findings underlie the importance of phenotyping single brain derived EVs to properly
characterize EV subpopulations and identify disease discriminators. Although several
single-particle characterization platforms have been proposed, their nanoscale multiplex
capabilities remain elusive..

METHODOLOGY: To explore the nanoscale multiplex capabilities of flow
cytometry, EVs spontaneously released by mouse brain tissue were subjected to high
sensitivity flow cytometry analysis of validated EV membrane tetraspanins, combining violet
side scatter-and fluorescence-based particle detection..

RESULTS: To explore the relative abundance of tetraspanins, we assessed EV
subpopulations positive for either CD9 or CD81, and both, in EVs simultaneously labelled
with APC-CD9 and PE-CD81 antibodies. First, we confirmed the capacity of our flow cytometry
analysis to distinguish between single-and double-positive events by comparing mixed EVs
individually labelled with APC-CD9 and PE-CD81, and simultaneously labelled EVs. APC/PE
double-positive events were only detected when simultaneously labelling EVs, and not when
individually labelled EVs are mixed prior to analysis, indicating the detection of
double-positive single nanoparticles in the absence of coincidental events due to swarming.
Further analysis of simultaneo-usly labelled EVs showed that 98% of APC-CD9+ events are
PE-CD81+, whereas 42% of PE-CD81+ events are APC-CD9+..

CONCLUSIONS: High sensitivity nanoscale flow cytometry analysis allowed
quantification of multiple surface markers in single brain derived EVs. This technology
holds enormous potential to categorize EV subpopulations and identify surface molecular
signatures of cell specific EVs for sorting and subsequent assessment of disease
bio-markers..

A sizeable body of evidence has recently emerged to suggest that gastrointestinal
inflammation might be involved in the development of Parkinson's disease. There is now
strong epidemiological and genetical evidence linking Parkinson's disease to inflammatory
bowel diseases and we recently demonstrated that the neuronal protein alpha-synuclein, which
is critically involved in Parkinson's disease pathophysiology, is upregulated in inflamed
segments of Crohn's colon. The microtubule associated protein tau is another neuronal
protein critically involved in neurodegenerative disorders but, by contrast to
alpha-synuclein, no data are available about its expression and phosphorylation patterns in
inflammatory bowel diseases. Here, we examined the expression levels of tau isoforms, their
phos-phorylation profile and truncation in colon biopsy specimens from 17 Crohn's disease
and 6 ulcerative colitis patients and compared them to samples from 12 controls. Additional
pharmacological experiments were performed in primary cultures of rat enteric neurons. Our
results show the upregulation of two main human tau isoforms in the enteric nervous system
in Crohn's disease but not in ulcerative colitis. This upregulation was not
transcriptionally regulated but instead resulted from a decrease in protein clearance via an
Nrf2/NDP52 pathway. Our findings, which provide the first detailed characterization of tau
in Crohn's disease, suggest that the key proteins involved in neurodegenerative disorders
such as alpha-synu-clein and tau, might also play a role in Crohn's disease..

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive age-related neuro-degenerative disorder affecting
approximately 35 million individuals worldwide. AD is a leading cause of death in the USA,
with an estimated 5.8 million affected and, by mid-century, the number is expected to grow
to 13.8 million. There are several well-established genetic and environmental factors
hypothesized to contribute to AD pathology and progression. Besides aging, various comorbid
factors also increase the risk of AD, including obesity, diabetes, air pollution, and
asthma. Epidemiological studies have reported a 2.17- fold higher risk of dementia in
asthmatic patients >45 years old and 1.27-fold in asthmatic patients ≥20 years old.
However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this asthma-associated AD exacerbation is not
known. This study was designed to explore the effects of house dust mite-induced asthma on
AD-related brain changes using the App
NL-G-F
 transgenic mouse model of disease. Male and female C57BL/6 wild type and
App
NL-G-F
mice (8-9 months old) were exposed to either saline vehicle or house dust mite at a
dose of 833µg/kg every alternate day for 16 weeks. Mice were sacrificed at the end of the
experiment to collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and brains. BALF was analyzed for
immune cell markers and inflammatory mediators by flow cytometry and cytokine arrays,
respectively. Aβ ELISAs were performed on frozen hippocampal lysates. As predicted, asthma
increased BALF inflammatory cells and several cytokine levels compared to the vehicle
controls. Interestingly, asthmatic App
NL-G-F
 mouse hippocampi had higher levels of soluble Aβ 1-40/42 and insoluble Aβ 1-40.
Understanding a mechanistic relationship tying AD and asthma progression may provide novel
therapeutic interventions for both of these chronic diseases..

APOE is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's
disease. ApoE exacerbates tau-associated neurodegeneration by driving microglial activation.
However, how apoE regulates microglial activation and whether targeting apoE is
therapeutically beneficial in tauopathy is unclear. Here we show that overexpressing an apoE
metabolic receptor LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) in P301S tauopathy mice markedly
reduces brain apoE, and ameliorates tau pathology and neurodegeneration. LDLR
overex-pression in microglia cell-autonomously downregulates microglial
Apoe expression, and is associated with suppressed microglial activation
as is in apoE-deficient microglia. Both apoE-deficiency and LDLR-overexpression strongly
drive microglial immunometa-bolism towards enhanced catabolism over anabolism, whereas
LDLR-overexpressing microglia also uniquely upregulate specific ion channels and
neurotransmitter receptors upon activation. ApoE-deficient and LDLR-overexpressing mice
harbor enlarged pools of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and show greater
preservation of myelin integrity under neurodegenerative conditions. They also show less
“disease-associated astrocyte” activation in the setting of tauopathy..

Leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators that may contribute to the development and
progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Repurposing of leukotriene receptor antagonists
(LTRAs), originally developed for asthma, is being explored in the treatment of Alz-heimer's
disease (AD); however, there is little evidence supporting its neuroprotective effects in
humans. Participants with AD dementia were identified in the National Alzheimer's
Coordinating Center database. LTRA users were propensity-matched 1:3 to non-users on age,
sex, education, body mass index, smoking history, concomitant use of medications for
dementia and other respiratory conditions, ApoE ε4 carrier status, Clinical Dementia Rating
(CDR) global score, and vascular brain disease. Cognitive domains including delayed memory
(Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised – Logical Memory IIA), psychomotor processing speed (Digit
Symbol Coding), and semantic verbal fluency (Animal Naming) were compared between users and
non-users in mixed-effects linear or Poisson regression models, as appropriate for the data
distribution, yielding unstandardized regression coefficients (B) and rate ratios (RR),
respectively. Among n=584 people with AD dementia (mean age 72.2±9.8 years, 59.8% female,
mean education 14.0±3.9 years, median CDR global score=1, 55.0% ε4 carriers, mean follow-up
2.35 years), LTRA use was associated with a slower decline in processing speed, as measured
by the Digit Symbol Coding test (Β=1.18 [0.090,2.26] symbols/year), and a slower decline in
verbal fluency, as measured by the Animal Naming test (Β=0.488 [0.150,0.827] animals/year),
but not with a change in logical memory performance (RR=1.06 [0.940,1.20]). These results
indicate that use of LTRAs may have benefits for preserving function for select cognitive
domains in individuals with AD. The leukotriene pathway may represent a target for the
treatment of AD and the role of leukotrienes and their receptors in cognitive decline
warrants further investigation..

We have previously developed a spectroscopy method based on Nile Red, a polarity-sensitive
lipophilic dye for detecting myelin changes at the earliest stages of myelin injury in the
cuprizone mouse model and normal appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis(MS) patients.
We proposed that increases in the measured dielectric constant of myelin, in
still-myelinated axons, may underpin physiologically important conduction block in MS and
other deor dysmye-linating disorders. Here we explore this question in heterozygous knockout
of the Pmp22 myelin gene, an established mouse model of hereditary neuropathy with liability
to pressure palsies(HNPP). Action potential conduction abnormalities, including conduction
block, are a hallmark of HNPP. Spinal roots from Pmp22+/- mice and age-matched wild-type
mice were labeled with NR and imaged on a spectral confocal microscope. In still-myelinated
axons, there was a significant (p<0.001, N=9 mice) increase in myelin polarity in
Pmp22+/- mice. NR spectroscopy revealed a significant polarity shift to higher values as
early as postnatal day 8 in Pmp22+/- nerves (p<0.001, N=4 mice). Tomacula, thickenings of
myelin segments characteristic of HNPP, showed an unexpected polarity gradient in-creasing
radially from outer to inner mesaxon. Lastly, we examined the role of non-polar cholesterol
in myelin polarity changes. We stained the nerves with filipin, a cholesterol-specific dye,
and found that filipin signal was reduced in myelin regions with increased polarity, this
lipid plays a key role in establishing normal physical properties of myelin. CONCLUSION: NR
spectroscopy reports early physicochemical changes in myelin in the PNS of Pmp22+/- mice,
with cholesterol playing a key role. Along with previously observed myelin junction
disruption and abnormally increased myelin perme-ability in HNPP mouse, the sensitive
measures of polarity using this method indicate that increases of myelin dielectric constant
in still-myelinated fibers reveal a new mechanism that may underpin clinically important
abnormalities of conduction. Supported by CIHR and NINDS R01NS115748.

Microtubules are polymers composed of αβ-tubulin subunits that provide structure to cells
and play a crucial role in the development and function of neuronal processes and cilia,
microtubule-driven extensions of the plasma membrane that have sensory (primary cilia) or
motor (motile cilia) functions. To stabilize microtubules in neuronal processes and cilia, α
tubulin is modified by the posttranslational addition of an acetyl group, or acetylation. We
discovered that acetylated tubulin in microtubules interacts with the membrane sphingolipid,
ceramide. However, the molecular mechanism and function of this interaction are not
understood. Here, we show that in human iPS cell-derived neurons, ceramide stabilizes
microtubules, which indicates a similar function in cilia. Using proximity ligation assays,
we detected complex formation of ceramide with acetylated tubulin in C.
reinhardtii flagella and cilia of human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells, primary
cultured mouse astrocytes, and ependymal cells. Using incorporation of palmitic azide and
click chemistry-mediated addition of fluorophores, we show that a portion of acetylated
tubulin is S-palmitoylated. S-palmitoylated acetylated tubulin is colocalized with
ceramide-rich platforms (CRPs) in the ciliary membrane, and it is coimmunoprecipitated with
Arl13b, a GTPase that mediates transport of proteins into cilia. Inhibition of
S-palmitoylation with 2-bromo palmitic acid or inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis with
fumonisin B1 reduces formation of the Arl13b-acetylated tubulin complex and its transport
into cilia, concurrent with impairment of ciliogenesis. Together, these data show, for the
first time, that CRPs mediate membrane anchoring and interaction of S-palmitoylated proteins
that are critical for cilium formation, stabilization, and function. This work was supported

We showed that deficiency of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) improves memory in
Alzheimer's disease model (5xFAD) and wildtype mice, indicating that nSMase2 regulates
neural function in the aging brain. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism,
targeted mass spectrometry (sphingolipidomics) and RNAseq analysis was performed on the
cortex from aging (10 months-old) nSMase2-deficient (fro/fro) and heterozygous (+/fro) mouse
brain. fro/fro brains showed reduced levels of ceramide, particularly in astrocytes. Gene
cluster (KEGG) analysis predicted that genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and
astrocyte activation were down-regulated. Genes in axon formation and synaptic signal
transduction such as the glutamate receptor subunit 2B (NR2b/Grin2B) were upre-gulated,
indicating a role of nSMase2 in the regulation of oxidative stress and cognition. In primary
astrocytes, oxidative stress decreased the level of glutathione (GSH) and increased
immunolabeling for ceramide in +/fro astrocytes, but not in fro/fro astrocytes. β-
glucosidase activity was lower in fro/fro astrocytes, indicating reduced senescence due to
nSMase2 deficiency. In fro/fro cortex, levels of the senescence markers C3b and p27, and the
pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β, (1L-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis
factor α (TNF-α) were significant reduced, concurrent with 2-fold decreased phosphorylation
of their downstream target, protein kinase Stat3. Consistent with RNAseq analysis, protein
levels of NR2b/Grin2b were elevated by 2-fold. In summary, our data indicate that nSMase2
deficiency and reduction of ceramide levels ameliorates oxidative stress, neuroinflammation,
and cognition in the aging brain. Funding: This work was supported by the NIH grants

established model of severe hereditary demyelinating neuropathies as they carry the same
Leu16Pro mutation in PMP22 which is found in DSS patients. Our previous studies of
2-9-month-old TrJ mice indicate severe phrenic nerve degeneration with significant
demye-lination, and a concurrent hypertrophy of diaphragm muscle fibers. To investigate the
underlying mechanism for this unexpected phenotype, we performed immunohistochemistry and
biochemical analyses of diaphragm tissues from 2-9-month-old male and female Wt and TrJ
mice. Immunolabeling with anti-actinin antibodies showed intact Z-lines in affected
diaphragms from 2-month-old mice, suggesting the preservation of functional contractile
units at this age. Western blot analyses of whole diaphragm tissue lysates demon-strated
significant (p<0.01) upregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and an increase in
the autophagy marker LC3II. Immuno-histochemistry on frozen diaphragm tissue sections
confirmed the biochemical results, as samples from neuropathic mice displayed in-creased
reactivity with antibodies against ubiquitin and the lysosomal membrane protein 1 (LAMP1).
As a follow up to the phrenic nerve degeneration, we also examined spinal cord cross
sections from vertebrae C3-C5 of 4-month-old male and female Wt and TrJ mice. Double
immunolabeling with cell type specific markers indicated astrogliosis in samples from TrJ
mice. Atypical neurofilament whirls were also seen in occasional ventral motor neurons,
demonstrating ongoing CNS pathology in phrenic neuropathy. Together, our results indicate
pathological degenerative events in both the PNS and CNS of neuropathic mice, co-occurring
with adaptive changes in the diaphragm. Further investigation of the respiratory
complications in neuropathic rodent models will contribute towards identifying the
appropriate tissue targets to improve human patient quality of life..

Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator for lysosomal and autophagosomal
genes. TFEB is a member of the MiTF-TFE family, which also includes TFE3, a similarly
regulated transcription factor that has overlapping targets. Recently, TFEB has been shown
to be a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte myelination and has been suggested to play a
role in myelin degradation in Schwann cells after nerve injury. The role of TFEB in
regulating myelination has not been thoroughly examined in the PNS. To investigate the role
of TFEB in Schwann cell myelination, we used both an in vitro gain of
function of TFEB and an in vivo dual loss of function of TFEB and TFE3
approaches. We generated Schwann cells in which a constitutively active, Flag-tagged TFEB
mutant (S211A) is expressed in a doxycycline-dependent manner. In Schwann cell-dorsal root
ganglion co-cultures, Flag-TFEBS211A expression inhibited myelin initiation and
early myelin growth. In mature myelin cultures, inducing Flag-TFEBS211A
expression reduced the number of existing myelin segments indicating a disruption in myelin
maintenance. Schwann cell proliferation was not significantly affected by
Flag-TFEBS211A expression. In vivo, preliminary analysis of
Schwann cell specific TFEB KO (Dhh-Cre;TFEBfl/fl) on a TFE3 global KO background
(dKO) mouse sciatic nerves show a mild increase in in-foldings and abnormal thickness by
P90. Our results suggest that aberrant activation or inactivation of TFEB in Schwann cell
disrupt myelin homeostasis..

Most treatments for demyelinating diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis, focus on targeting
focal inflammatory lesions. However, treatments to enhance myelin repair after lesion are
still needed. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that the metabotropic
glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonists, 1-amino-1,3-dicarbo-xycyclopentane and
(R,S)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG) enhance myelin proteins in a lesion site
through release of the growth factor BDNF from astrocytes, mediated through mGluR5 (Fulmer
et al, 2014; Saitta et al, 2021). Here, we assess the effects of CHPG in the MOG-induced EAE
mouse model. Studies demonstrate that CHPG injections (20mg/kg; i.p.; every other day) from
day 12 post induction, significantly reduce clinical scores from day 20 to 30. CHPG-treated
EAE mice present tail paralysis as opposed to saline-injected controls that exhibit hindlimb
weakness. Western blot analysis of the lumbar spinal cord on day 21 demonstrates that CHPG
elevates myelin proteins and GFAP while BDNF is unaffected. Immunohistochemistry reveals an
increase in GFAP+ astrocytic profiles and a decrease in numbers of Ly-6g+ neutrophils in the
ventral white matter. CHPG treatment of EAE mice at late stages of disease significantly
attenuate disease progression between day 23 and 30. The reduction, though, is of less
magnitude. This effect was accompanied by reversal of the loss in BDNF and PLP in the lumbar
spinal cord to unlesioned control levels. Colocalization of mGluR5 with GFAP+ astrocytes,
Ly-6g+ neutrophils and rarely Iba1+ activated microglia is noted within the lesion,
indicating that these cells may be targets of CHPG. To define the role of astrocyte-derived
mGluR5, effects of CHPG were examined in inducible-conditional hGFAP-CreERT2-mGluR5 fl/fl
ROSA26 mice. The deletion of mGluR5 inhibits effects of CHPG. The data suggest that
targeting astrocyte-derived mGluRs might provide a new therapeutic opportunity, although
other immune cells may be involved..

CHRONIC DEMYELINATION AND REMYELINATION OF SPARED AXONS AFTER SPINAL CORD
INJURY

Spinal cord injury (SCI) renders motor and sensory deficits below the level of injury, in
part, due to severed axons and extensive axon demyelination. Demyelination blocks or slows
down conduction through spared axons, leading to functional impairments. This is in part due
to node Ranvier disruption as highly organized proteins around the node, like contactin
associated protein (Caspr) and voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv1.2), spread along axons.
After SCI, some demyelinated axons are spontaneously remyelinated by newly formed
oligodendrocytes acutely, which improves neuronal communication. Because it is thought to be
incomplete, remyelina-tion is often pursued as a therapeutic strategy to restore function
after SCI; however, the target and duration for remyelination remains unknown. Here,
we tested the hypothesis that new myelin forms on demyelinated axons chronically
after SCI. For this, reporter mice were used to quantify the amount of new myelin
formed during specific periods of recovery. In naïve mice, only ∼5% of axons were wrapped in
new myelin. However, after SCI, remyelination significantly increased and peaked during the
3rd month post-injury (mpi) when over 15% of axons were remyelinated. Interestingly, spared
axons continued to be remyelinated for at least 26wpi, although at a lower rate. To
determine if chronic remyelination repaired all demye-linated axons, the number of intact
nodes of Ranvier were quantified. Intact nodes were 6.5x lower after SCI compared to naïve,
and there was marked spreading of Caspr and Kv1.2 along axons, which persisted for at least
26wpi. The presence of demyelinated axons at chronic timepoints was confirmed with electron
microscopy. Overall this work shows that demyelination persists chronically post-SCI, but
that spontaneous remyelination of a subset of axons continues chronically.This reveals that
the chronic spinal cord injury site remains a surprisingly dynamic environment even 6mpi,
and raises hope that endogenous progenitor cells remain responsive to environmental cues and
may be a feasible target to promote more complete remyelination chronically after SCI..

TGFBETA1 DEPENDENT GPNMB EXPRESSION IN NEURAL STEM CELLS INHIBITS
OLIGODENDROGENESIS
.

University of Wisconsin-Madison, Comparative Biosciences, Madison, USA
.

Demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) is a patho-logical feature of many
neurodegenerative diseases, and leads to altered signaling, axonal stress, and
neurodegeneration. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) presents with widespread demyelination, which is
refractory to current treatments and interventions. Recent research identified a population
of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) that express the transcription factor Gli1 in the adult
subventricular zone (SVZ) and are capable of generating new oligodendrocytes for
remye-linating the CNS. Loss of Gli1 in these NSCs further increases their recruitment to
the site of demyelination and differentiation into mye-linating oligodendrocytes, with
functional improvement in an Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. To
understand the molecular underpinnings of enhanced remyelina-tion, we performed an RNAseq
screen in NSCs with loss of Gli1 from demyelinated brain and identified Glycoprotein
non-metastatic melanoma b (Gpnmb) as the most differentially expressed gene with ∼6 fold
higher expression in wildtype NSCs. In the healthy brain, Gpnmb is expressed in subsets of
NSCs, microglia, astrocytes, oligo-dendrocyte precursors (OPCs), and neurons but not mature
oligo-dendrocytes. Global knockout of Gpnmb results in an increase in mature oligodendrocyte
generation during remyelination, while over-expression of Gpnmb in vitro
suppresses oligodendrocyte gene expression; thus indicating that Gpnmb inhibits
remyelination. We also found that TGFß1 secreted from the site of demyelination increases
Gpnmb expression in NSCs. In addition, increased Gpnmb levels stimulate TGFß-R2 expression,
the ligand binding subunit of the TGFß1 receptor dimer, indicating Gpnmb may function in a
feed-forward loop to sensitize NSCs to TGFß1. Taken together, our data strongly implicate
Gpnmb as a negative regulator of remyelination that is regulated by and feeds forward to
amplify TGFß1 signaling..

The CNS autoimmune disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is characterized by demyelination and
neurodegeneration. Currently, there are no available therapies marketed for myelin
repair/regeneration in MS. As MS is a chronic disease that often presents in young
adulthood, there is a need for both halting progression and repairing existing damage. In an
effort to repurpose FDA approved medication to expedite therapies to patients, we tested the
cardiac glycoside (Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor) digoxin and revealed it
promoted differentiation of the oligodendrocyte cell lineage in vitro and in
vivo in C57BL/6J mice. Digoxin stimulated a more robust recovery
of mye-linated axons in the LPC spinal cord model and a quicker restoration of myelin
integrity in the corpus callosum in the non-T cell-mediated Cuprizone model of
demyelination/remyelination as well as improved clinical score throughout the autoreactive
Th1/Th17 driven C57BL/6J chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE) time course. Available FDA-approved disease modifying therapies for MS are global
immunosuppressants with limited efficiency. Our lab is able to induce immune tolerance to
selectively target the immune system in relapsing-remitting (RR-EAE) and chronic progressive
(C-EAE) experimental autoimmune encephalo-myelitis murine models of MS using an i.v.
infusion of nanoparticles coupled with or encapsulating myelin peptides (Ag-PLG) that
pro-phylactically prevent disease and therapeutically stop disease progression without
compromising the entire adaptive immune system. Combination therapy with selective immune
regulation (PLG-MOG) and digoxin at peak of C-EAE disease completely ameliorated clinical
disease severity and restored the oligodendrocyte cell lineage. These findings provide
pre-clinical evidence for future clinical trials using combination therapy in MS
patients..

ROLE OF TIM-2 IN CNS MYELINATION
.

Myelin, which is formed by oligodendrocytes (OLs) in the central nervous system (CNS), is
crucial for efficient signal transduction and neuronal function. Iron is a critical
micronutrient for OLs due to its role as a cofactor for myelin synthesis, and it is
well-known that OLs are the highest iron staining cells in the brain. Inadequate iron
delivery to OLs frequently results in severe and long-lasting neuro-logical deficits that
are attributed to hypomyelination. Our laboratory and others have identified H-ferritin
(Fth), traditionally considered solely an iron storage protein, as the primary iron delivery
protein to OLs. We have also found that H-ferritin utilizes a novel receptor on rodent OLs,
T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein-2 (Tim-2). To ascertain the
importance of H-ferritin-mediated iron delivery through Tim-2 on OLs for myelination, we
have generated Timd2
fl/fl

Plp1-Cre/ERT conditional knockout mice to eliminate Tim-2 expression
specifically from OLs following tamoxifen injections. We hypothesize that removal of Tim-2
from OLs will lead to decreased H-ferritin uptake leading to insufficient myelination. In
this study, we observed that Timd2
fl/fl

Plp1-Cre/ERT mice injected with 75 mg/kg tamoxifen on post-natal days 7-9
to induce the knockout displayed a trend towards poorer motor function on the rotarod as
measured by increased number of falls and decreased latency to fall. In addition, there is a
statistically significant reduction in myelin basic protein (MBP) in animals that received
tamoxifen compared to controls. Essentially, the data from this study indicates that myelin
is negatively affected following Tim- 2 knockout from OLs..

Multiple different neurological disorders, like neurodegenerative disorders or neural
insults such as stroke create a neuroinflammatory response that leads to glial cell
activation. These cells change their conformation and take on multiple different phenotypes,
causing them to lose much of their normal functions and take on an inflammatory role.
Activation of microglia following injury leads to the conversion of astrocytes into an “A1”
phenotype that is more neurotoxic in (Parkinson's Disease and optic nerve crush models).
Three cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1a (Il-1a), and complement
component 1q (C1q) are released from microglia and have been determined to induce the A1
astrocyte phenotype. We prevented “A1” neurotoxic astrocyte formation after stroke with
triple knockout (TNF-, Il-1a-, and C1q-) mice, and compared their neuroinflammatory response
and stroke size to wildtype mice. We hypothesized that inhibition of “A1” astrocytes in
triple knockout mice would lead to less astrogliosis and reduced infarct size. Following
distal middle cerebral artery occlusion, the infarct size of triple knockout mice was
significantly less than wildtype mice at both 1 (p<0.05) and 7 days
(p<0.0001) post-ischemia. We also found a reduction in astrogliosis in
the triple knockout animals 7 days post-stroke (p<0.05). No significant
reduction of infarct size (p= 0.4343) was found 28 days post-dMCAO, but
there was a reduction in astrogliosis (p<0.05) in the triple knockout
animals. Removing “A1” neurotoxic astrocytes from the neuroinflammatory response to stroke
led to a reduction in the glial response to stroke and reduced infarct volume. Understanding
the neurotoxic phenotype of this astrocyte activation and its feedback role on other
resident and infiltrating cells could lead to treatments to reduce an exacerbated
neuroinflammatory response..

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PGE2 glial production by mPGES1 on
intestinal permeability, motility and inflammation in vivo in mouse model of colitis, and ex
vivo on human samples, and to associate these data with the expression level of mPGES1 in
EGC from IBD patients. We generated mice expressing the tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase
under control of the S100bpromoter and carrying the mPGES1fl-fl gene
(S100bCre-ERT2–mPGES1fl-fl). The effects of mPGES1 deletion were
analyzed in 10- 20 weeks old male or female (mPGES1 DEGC mice) and compared to 10-20 weeks
old male or female S100bCre-ERT2 or mPGES1fl-fl(control mice), treated
with tamoxifen too. Two weeks after the onset of the induction of deletion, we induced, or
not, the development of colitis by adding dextran sulfate sodium (DSS 4%) in the drinking
water during 4 days. Paracellular permeability, gut motility, total transit time and Disease
Activity Index (DAI) were evaluated. PGE2 and estradiol impact on glia and/or intestinal
epithelial cells were assessed in vitro. IHC analyses were also assessed on human control
and IBD samples.The increase in mPGES1 glial expression observed after exposure to DSS in
the myenteric ganglia of male and female wild control mice is absent in
mPGES1KOEGC mice. mPGES1 deletion had no impact on male intestinal function, in
control or DSS conditions. The female mice deleted for glial mPGES1 presented comparable
permeability and DAI, and transit time as male. Remarkably, wild type female had higher
control permeability and higher mPGES1-glial expression. This work represents the first in
vivo evidence of direct involvement of glial-derived PGE2 in the pathophysiology of the
intestine. It can regulate intestinal permeability and motility and sensitize the
development of colitis in female mice..

Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and dysregulated immune signaling. ER stress occurs when the protein folding
capacity of the ER is overwhelmed, resulting in initiation of the unfolded protein response
(UPR) to restore homeostasis. Unresolved UPR activation leads to cell death and
inflammation. We have described an ER-stress induced Janus Kinase (JAK) 1 - Signal
Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) 3-dependent mechanism that promotes
expression of inflammatory mediators including Interleukin-6 (IL-6). JAK1 is initiated by
cytokine stimulation to promote inflammatory gene expression, and additionally, using
RNA-seq, we have shown JAK1 controls many ER stress-induced genes. We found that less than
10% of the ER stress-induced JAK1-dependent genes are also induced by cytokine stimulation,
demonstrating ER stress and cyto-kine stimulation induce distinct JAK1-dependent
transcriptional pro-files in astrocytes, a nonneuronal brain cell that responds to insult by
producing soluble immune mediators. We found that JAK1 controls expression of genes that are
not regulated by STATs, but by activating transcription factor (ATF) 4. We have shown that
JAK1 and ATF4 physically interact and, via chromatin immunopre-cipitation (ChIP), in
response to ER stress, ATF4 is effectively recruited to these promoters of these genes in a
JAK1-dependent manner suggesting that JAK1 is involved in directing ATF4-dependent gene
expression in a gene specific manner. These findings suggest JAK1 is a major driver of
transcription in response to cellular stress, and JAK1 exhibits novel signaling mechanisms
to regulate gene expression through ATF4..

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infection is a common and devastating complication of the
treatment of hydrocephalus. The majority of these infections are cause by S.
epidermidis and can lead to long term neurologic consequences such as seizures
and decreased IQ. The mechanisms by which these consequences occur are unknown. Our
preliminary studies in a rat model of CSF revealed elevated levels of many complement
components at late time points when bacterial burdens were low suggesting a role for
complement beyond bacterial opsonization. Complement has been associated with the
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as MS and Alz-heimer's as well as CNS
infections such as HIV and bacterial meningitis. More recently there is evidence to support
the role of complement components in directing developmentally appropriate synaptic pruning.
This literature and our preliminary studies suggest that complement may be responsible for
the neurologic damage that occurs in response to shunt infection. We hypothesize that
complement creates these deleterious neurologic effects through pathologic pruning of neural
synapses. To evaluate this hypothesis we used a standardized mouse model of S.
epidermidis CNS catheter infections, allowing for the evaluation of host response
to infection. Early data demonstrated elevated levels of the complement components C3 and C5
at day 5 post-infection when bacterial burdens are low suggesting a role beyond control of
the infection. Additional studies comparing WT and C3 KO mice demonstrate a trend towards
increased synaptic number in C3 KO mice compared to WT which supports our hypothesis that
complement is responsible for pathologic synaptic pruning in S. epidermidis
shunt infection. Interestingly, Factor B is elevated at all time points in animals with
S. epidermidis infected CNS catheters indicating that the alternative
pathway may be major mode of complement activation during these infections and a potential
target for therapeutic interventions..

Entry of pathogenic T cells into the central nervous system (CNS) causes disease in the
multiple sclerosis (MS) animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
Extravasation across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) occurs via transcellular trafficking
within endocytic vesicles or by tight junction dissolution. Our previous data suggested that
encephalitogenic Th1 cells utilize Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) to cross the BBB in
MOG35-55 EAE. However, Cav-1 is expressed on T cells, endothelial cells, and
neurons. Additionally, the molecular signals targeting migratory T cells to trans-cellular,
instead of paracellular, BBB migration remain unclear. Th1 cells highly express the
chemokine receptor CXCR3, and its ligand CXCL10 is upregulated in the CNS in MS and EAE.
Here, we have tested the hypothesis that CXCR3 promotes migration of T cells across the BBB
dependent on endothelial Cav-1. CXCR3+ T cells were reduced in the spinal cords of Cav-1
null mice with EAE. CXCL10 enhanced transcellular chemotaxis across primary BBB endothelial
cells. We utilized novel endothelial cell conditional Cav-1 knockout mice to further probe
this hypothesis. Our findings suggest that chemokine-mediated caveolar transmigration may be
a target for modulating BBB permeability..

Astrocytes are heterogeneous glial cells that maintain homeostasis and provide for defense
of the central nervous system (CNS). In response to CNS damage they undergo morphological
and functional alterations collectively termed reactive astrogliosis. However, the capacity
of astrocytes to participate in immune interactions is still incompletely understood.
Interferon γ (IFNγ), an inflammatory cyto-kine, induces expression and plasmalemmal
translocation of major histocompatibility type II molecules (MHCII) that present antigens on
cell surface. To identify principal vesicles involved in MHCII delivery and retention at the
plasmalemma of cultured rat astrocytes, we investigated the subcellular localization of
MHCII by confocal and structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and examined exo-/
endocytotic interactions at a single vesicle level by high-resolution cell-attached membrane
capacitance measurements. Astrocyte treatment with IFNγ increased the expression of MHCII,
which upon immunolabelling strongly co-localized with LAMP1-EGFP, a marker of lysosomes, but
only scarcely with immunolabelled Rab4A, EEA1 and TPC1, markers of early and recycling
endosomes. As revealed by SIM, numerous MHCII-positive vesicles were positioned at the
plasmalemma and displayed larger diameters in IFNγ-treated astrocytes as compared to
non-treated controls. Furthermore, MHCII localized to the plasmalemma exclusively in
IFNγ-treated astrocytes. Membrane capacitance measurements revealed reversible and full
exo-/endocytotic vesicle interactions with the plasmalemma. Following IFNγ treatment,
reversible exocytosis of vesicles with larger diameter was observed. Additionally, IFNγ
treatment reduced the frequency of full endocytotic events. In IFNγ-treated astrocytes,
exocytosis of predominately larger lysosomes accompanied by concomitant inhibition of
endocytosis mediates translocation and prolonged retention of MHCII on cell surface..

TDP-43 proteinopathy is characterized by a consistent cytoplasmic mislocalization and
aggregation of the protein TDP-43. This event is specific for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
(ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) but has also been observed in other
neurodegenerative disorders (Arai et al. 2014). Different studies highlighted the
sensitivity of the RRM1 domain of the protein in TDP-43 proteinopathy induction (Chang et
al. 2013; Shodai et al. 2013) and NF-kB pathway activation (Swarup et al. 2011)..

We recently developed two antibody-based approaches, to target and overcome TDP-43
proteinopathy. In particular, a monoclonal full-length antibody (Pozzi et al. 2020) and a
single chain antibody (Pozzi et al. 2019), both specifically directed against the RRM1
domain of TDP-43, were generated and tested in ALS/FTLD mouse models..

The full-length antibody recognized specifically the cytoplasmic fraction of TDP-43 in
cells, animal models and ALS human tissues. In neuronal cells the antibody reduced the
cytoplasmic TDP-43 by activating the TRIM-21/proteasome degradative pathway. In tissues of
treated mice, the antibody decreased the levels of cytoplasmic TDP-43 and nuclear p65, the
active subunit of NF-kB. The single chain antibody demonstrated to rescue motor and
cognitive impairments in animal models. It reduced the amount of cytoplasmic accumulated
TDP-43 by targeting the protein to degradative pathways and it blocked the interaction
between TDP-43 and p65, decreasing neuroinflammation in mice..

With these studies we demonstrated the efficacy of two antibody-based approaches against
the RRM1-domain of TDP-43 in reducing the intracellular TDP-43 proteinopathy and rescuing
deficits in ALS/ FTLD mouse models..

Down Syndrome (DS), a neurodevelopmental disorder which arises from the presence of an
extra copy of chromosome 21, is linked with an increased risk of developing early-onset
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three dimensional (3D) oligocortical spheroids (OLS) generated
from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells permit innovatory observation of
brain development; they have previously been validated to recapitulate the cortical
architecture of the human fetal brain along with the presence of neurons, oligodendro-cytes
and astrocytes. Herein we present a thorough analysis of the DS-derived OLS utilizing
immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) comparing cellular
diversity, cell lineage development, and the AD-related pathological features in isogenic
trisomic and euploid OLS. We have recently reported myelin-related abnormalities in DS human
brain and Ts65Dn mouse model. Using this novel in vitro 3D system, we evaluated
oligo-dendrocyte development and myelin production in trisomic and euploid OLS. We have
specially developed a MATLAB application to quantify fate-and stage-specific markers.
Trisomic OLS faithfully recapitulated the development of AD-related pathology including
depositions of amyloid-beta and activation of caspase 3 accompanied by the profoundly
reduced spheroid volume. Our scRNA-seq analysis identified 15 different cell clusters with
diverse transcriptional signatures. Subsequent gene ontology analysis revealed that the
excitatory neuron clusters demonstrate significant enrichment for processes related to
enhanced transcription and translation as well as for the genes implicated previously in AD.
We uncovered a profound dysregulation of the pathways mediating axonal guidance, neuron
migration, cell-to-cell adhesion and nervous system development in trisomic excitatory
neurons. This implies that these pathways can be implicated in neuronal networks,
connectivity, and synaptogenesis, and contribute to the intellectual deficits observed in DS
individuals. Our translational, human-directed study contributes to the understanding of
DS-associated cell pathology and comorbidity with AD..

Linoleic acid derived lipoxygenase hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid metabolites (9-HODE and
13-HODE) have anti-inflammatory properties but their clinical associations with Alzheimer's
disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) have not been established. We
aim to examine these metabolites with respect to microstructural white matter integrity and
vascular brain lesion characteristics. Patients from memory and stroke prevention clinics
(n=69) were stratified based on SIVD (minimal vs. abundant white matter hyperintensities
[WMH] based on 3.0T structural MRI), and AD (clinical diagnosis). 9-HODE and 13-HODE were
extracted from serum using solid phase extraction and concentrations measured by ultra
high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Microstructural brain tissue
integrity was examined as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) using
diffusion tensor imaging. Using multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for age and
sex, 13-HODE was lower in people with AD (F1,68=6.52, p=0.013, n=23) but not with
SIVD (F1,68=0.14, p=0.7, n=38). 13-HODE was associated with higher FA in normal
appearing white matter (β=0.303, p=0.017), negatively associated with periventricular WMH-FA
(β=-0.381, p=0.048), and positively associated with with periventricular WMH-MD (β=0.257,
p=0.048). In patients without AD, 9-HODE and 13-HODE were negatively associated with WMH
volume (β=-0.322, p=0.018 and β=-0.324, p=0.019). Additionally, 9- HODE was positively
associated with FA in normal appearing white matter (β=0.341, p=0.041) and periventricular
WMH-MD (β=0.381, p=0.025). Anti-inflammatory linoleic acid oxylipins were associated with
preserved white matter integrity, smaller vascular brain lesion volumes, and vascular brain
lesion microstructural characteristics. AD was associated with a relative deficit in these
mediators..

Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized patho-logically by accumulation of
abnormal Tau in the brain. However, it remains unclear how these molecular and cellular
dysfunctions lead to behavioral deficits, especially during the early stages of
patho-genesis. To dissect disease mechanisms across multiple biological scales, we generated
a zebrafish model of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a primary tauopathy causing
unexpected falls in patients early in disease progression, by expressing human 0N/4R-Tau in
the evolutionarily conserved vestibulospinal (VS) nucleus. Human Tau-expressing zebrafish
exhibit impaired balance control during free-swimming while maintaining normal locomotor
ability compared to their siblings. Functional imaging of the VS nucleus shows decreased
calcium signals in Tau-expressing neurons in response to tilt stimulus. This altered
neuronal activity correlates with Tau phos-phorylation in VS neurons. Interestingly, we also
observed ectopic accumulation of acidic organelles in the cell bodies of Tau-positive
neurons, suggesting abnormal lysosomal function. Taken together, our zebrafish PSP model
allows us to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of balance deficits in tauopathies
and can be a powerful system for preclinical drug screening and evaluation of potential
therapeutic targets..

Focal ischemic stroke (FIS) is a leading cause of human death. Reactive gliosis is a
hallmark of FIS characterized by dramatic spatial and temporal changes of morphology of
reactive astrocytes, gene expression in reactive astrocytes and glial scar formation in
peri-infarct region (PIR). Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was originally
isolated from a rat glioma cell-line supernatant and is a potent survival neurotrophic
factor. In our previous study, we found reactive astrocytes expressed enhanced GDNF after
photothrombosis (PT)-induced FIS, and deletion of GDNF in astro-cytes using inducible and
conditional knockout mice lead to increased neuronal death and brain infarction after PT.
Moreover, deletion of GDNF reduced proliferation of reactive astrocytes compared based on
Brdu and Ki67 staining in the PIR, indicating that astrocytic GDNF can promote neural
regeneration. Furthermore, behavioral tests showed that deletion of GDNF increased motor
function impairment after PT. Our study indicate that endogenous GDNF in reactive astrocytes
has beneficial effect on poststroke brain repair. Here we overexpress GDNF in reactive
astrocytes using AAV virus injection for gain-of-function study. We found astrocyte-specific
GDNF overexpression can significantly decreased infarct volume and promoted motor function
recovery after PT. In summary, our study suggests that reactive astrocytes-derived GDNF
plays important roles in reducing neuronal death and brain damage through a non-cell
autonomous effect after FIS, and promoting endogenous neurotrophic factor release from
reactive astrocytes might be a potential approach in stroke therapy..

One of the early consequences of ischemic injury and glutamate receptor hyperactivation is
neuronal swelling or cytotoxic edema, caused by sodium and chloride entry and followed by
irreversible damage to the plasma membrane..

Here we show that ischemia and excess NMDA receptor activation cause actin filaments to
rapidly reorganize within the somatoden-dritic compartment. Normally F-actin is concentrated
within den-dritic spines, with little F-actin in the dendrite shaft. However, after
incubation of neurons with NMDA, F-actin depolymerizes within dendritic spines and
polymerizes into long filament bundles within the dendrite shaft and soma. A similar
“actinification” of the somatodendritic compartment occurs after oxygen/glucose deprivation
in vitro, and in mouse brain after photothrombotic stroke in
vivo. These actin changes spontaneously reverse within 1-2 hours, if the exposure
to NMDA is transient. We find that actinification is triggered by neuronal swelling, which
depends on Na+ and Cl− influx..

However, it requires also Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space, rather than
from the intracellular stores. It is mediated by activation of the F-actin elongation factor
inverted formin-2 (INF2), modulated by acetylation and dependent on the disassembly of
F-actin in den-dritic spines. Silencing of INF2 renders neurons more vulnerable to
NMDA-induced membrane leakage and cell death. Inhibition of formin activity markedly
increases ischemic infarct severity in vivo. Overall, these results uncover
a novel neuron-specific pro-survival response that protects neurons from ischemic death..

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with devastating neurological problems affecting
more than 11,000 Americans each year. Although several treatment agents have been proposed
and tested, no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy is available for treating SCI. We have recently
demonstrated that estrogen (E2) acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent,
attenuating gliosis in SCI. We have also demonstrated that nanoparticle-mediated focal
delivery of E2 to the injured spinal cord decreases lesion size, reactive gliosis, and glial
scar formation. The current study tested in vitro effects of E2 on reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and calpain activity in microglia, astroglia, macrophages, and
fibroblasts, which are believed to participate in the inflammatory events and glial scar
formation after SCI. E2 treatment decreased ROS production and calpain activity in these
glial cells, macrophages, and fibroblast cells in vitro. This study also
designed and tested the efficacy of fast and slow release nano-particle-E2 constructs in a
rat model of SCI. Focal delivery of E2 via nanoparticles increased tissue distribution of E2
over time, attenuated cell death, and improved myelin preservation in injured spinal cord.
Specifically, the fast release nanoparticle-E2 construct (PLGA-E2) reduced the Bax/Bcl-2
ratio in injured spinal cord tissues, and the slow release nanoparticle-E2 construct
(PLA-E2) protected myelina-tion below the lesion site in penumbra. These data suggest that
this novel delivery strategy of E2 to the lesion site of spinal cord may decrease
inflammation and improve functional outcomes in SCI..

CMT1X is an inherited peripheral neuropathy caused by mutations in the GJB-1 gene that
encodes for connexin 32 (Cx32). Despite being the second most common form of CMT
neuropathies, there are no pharmacologic treatments for CMT1X. We have developed
“novologues” as orally bioavailable novobiocin analogues that manifest neuroprotective
activity by modulating the expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). The novologue,
KU-596, is in clinical trials for treating a metabolic neuropathy and we examined if it may
improve neuropathic symptoms in Cx32 deficient (Cx32def) mice, an authentic mouse model of
human CMT1X. Cx32def mice develop a significant reduction in motor nerve conduction velocity
(MNCV, ∼45 m/sec) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP,∼20- 25mV) compared to
wild-type mice (MNCV, ∼60 m/sec; CMAP,∼40 mV). Beginning at 4 months of age, 5 months of
daily KU-596 therapy significantly improved MNCV (∼ 55-60 m/sec) and CMAP (∼ 30 mV). To
investigate whether these effects were Hsp70 dependent, Cx32def x Hsp70 knockout mice were
treated with KU-596. While the deletion of Hsp70 did not affect the development of
peripheral neuropathy, the therapeutic efficacy of KU-596 was Hsp70 dependent since, there
were no improvements in MNCV and CMAP. To determine if KU-596 may be effective in other
models of CMT1X, we utilized T55I x Cx32def mice. T55I is a common Cx32 mutation in human
CMT1X patients, which leads to accumulation of Cx32 in the endoplasmic reticulum. These mice
develop similar deficits in MNCV (∼45-50 m/sec), CMAP (∼20 mV). Five months of daily
treatment with KU-596 improved MNCV (∼ 60 m/sec) but did not significantly improve CMAP.
Collectively, our data suggests that modulating Hsp70 with KU-596 may be beneficial for
treating CMT1X and that efficacy may not be limited by the nature of the underlying genetic
mutation in the GJB-1 gene..

Similar to other central nervous system neurons, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the
projection neurons of the retina, fail to regenerate after injury. In glaucoma, as the
second leading cause of blindness, degeneration of RGC axons and subsequent death of their
soma are two key pathological events that lead to irreversible loss of vision. However, no
effective treatment targeting RGC vulnerability is yet available. A key obstacle toward
developing novel therapeutics is the lack of sufficient understanding of mechanisms that
regulate RGC survival and axon regeneration. Here, we leveraged the mouse optic nerve crush
model – in which ∼80% of RGCs die within 2 weeks after insult to their axon – and undertook
a large-scale in vivo CRISPR screen to identify key regulators of such mechanisms. Our
screen revealed multiple genes whose removal from retinal cells promoted RGC survival and/or
axon regeneration. One of the strongest protective phenotypes belongs to the knockout of the
gene encoding c-Jun N-terminal kinases-Interacting Protein 3 (JIP3; Also known as MAPK8IP3).
Then, we performed transcriptomic analysis of RGCs with or without JIP3 at different time
points after optic nerve crush to further investigate molecular programs underlying
JIP3-dependent RGC survival, and identified candidate genes that regulate survival of
RGCs..

Purpose: Genetic Leukoencephalopathies (gLEs) are white matter
disorders affecting the central nervous system, causing progressive abnormalities in the
visual and motor systems. A mutation in VPS11 has been identified as a
causative allele of gLE in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, with a high carrier rate of 1:250.
VPS11 forms mem-brane-tethering complexes with three additional VPS proteins to control
vesicle fusion within the endolysosomal and autophagy pathways. Here, we are characterizing
a zebrafish vps11 mutant as a potential model for gLE.
Methods: Behavioral responses to visual and acoustic cues was
performed at 5- and 7-days post-fertilization (dpf) using the DanioVision Noldus tracking
system. In addition, optokinetic response (OKR) analysis was performed at 5dpf to test
visual acuity. Results: Behavioral analysis showed that
vps11 mutant fish could visualize changes in light and dark backgrounds,
but OKR analysis indicated the animals were functionally blind and not able to make out an
image. Regarding motor movement, no difference in response to alternating light-dark
backgrounds was observed between the mutant and wild-type larvae at 5dpf, but a significant
reduction in movement of the mutants at 7dpf. Mutants also showed a progressive reduction in
movement to non-visual, acoustic stimuli. Together, these results suggest that loss of Vps11
function has a progressive adverse effect on visuomotor system development in zebrafish.
Conclusions: Our findings support the use of zebrafish to further
characterize the vision and motor defects associated with loss of Vps11 function..

The neuropilin receptors and their semaphorin ligands play key roles in brain circuit
development by regulating numerous crucial neuronal processes, including synapse maturation
and migration of GABAergic interneurons. Consistent with its developmental roles, the
neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) locus contains polymorphisms in patients with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD). Nrp2 deficient mice show autism-like behavioral deficits and propensity to develop
seizures. In order to determine the pathophysiology in Nrp2 deficiency, we examined the
hippocampal interneuron subtypes and inhibitory regulation of CA1 pyramidal neurons in mice
lacking one or both copies of Nrp2. Immunostaining for interneurons revealed that Nrp2-/-
mice have reduced number of parvalbumin, somatostatin and Neuro-peptide Y cells, mainly in
CA1. Whole cell recordings identified reduced firing and hyperpolarized shift in resting
membrane potential in CA1 pyramidal neurons from Nrp2+/- and Nrp2-/- mice compared to
Nrp2+/+ indicating decrease in intrinsic excitability. Simultaneously, the frequency and
amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) are reduced in Nrp2
deficient mice. A convulsive dose of kainic acid evoked electrographic and behavioral
seizures with significantly shorter latency, longer duration and higher severity in Nrp2-/-
compared to Nrp2+/+ animals. Finally, Nrp2+/- and Nrp2-/-, but not Nrp2+/+, mice have
impaired cognitive flexibility demonstrated by reward-based reversal learning, a task
associated with hippocampal function. Together these results demonstrate a broad reduction
in interneuron subtypes and compromised inhibition in CA1 of Nrp2-/- mice, which could
contribute to the heightened seizure susceptibility and behavioral deficits consistent with
an ASD/epilepsy phenotype..

Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the
MECP2 gene. The MeCP2 protein is a critical transcriptional regulator in the CNS responsible
for neuro-typical function and maturation. Persons with RTT experience symptom onset after a
period of typical development between 6 to 18 months of age, causing regressions in motor
abilities, development of breathing abnormalities, and intellectual impairments requiring
life-long care. Mecp2-/y Mouse models similarly recapitulate these symptoms and provide a
basis for understanding cellular contribution to disease progression. Previous studies have
demonstrated that astrocytes contribute to RTT pathogenesis, but the exact mechanisms are
not well understood. Astrocytes undergo postnatal maturation alongside neurons, indicated by
changes in cellular function, and development of a complex morphological phenotype.
Surprisingly little is understood regarding astrocyte gene expression during this period of
morphological maturation. Using cell-specific isolation of cortical astrocytes, we evaluated
the gene expression in wilde-type (WT) and Mecp2-/y mice from early postnatal development
through adulthood..

We found the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the period of
murine astrocyte morphogenesis (P14 – P28) in WT animals. While WT astrocytes have
enrichment of pathways associated with cellular morphology and maturation, these pathways
are disrupted in Mecp2-/y astrocytes. We also used an AAV construct to drive
astrocyte-specific expression of fluorescent mem-brane markers, determining that Mecp2-/y
animals have deficits in astrocyte morphogenesis at the end of this developmental period at
P28, but not prior to it at P14. These results suggest that disruption of astrocyte gene
pathways in RTT may have functional relevance..

The adult mammalian brain nurtures neural stem cells (NSCs) that participate in the
neurogenesis—the phenomenon refers to the origin of new and functional neurons. This event
involves multiple complex processes that include proliferation, differentiation and fate
determination of NSCs and the maturation, migration, survival and functional integration of
developing neurons in the adult brain..

These NSCs reside in the brain as specialized micro-environment called neurogenic niche.
The most studied and accepted neurogenic niches are the sub-ventricular zone [SVZ] of the
lateral ventricles and the sub-granular zone [SGZ] of the hippocampal dentate gyrus..

A growing body of evidence supports the link between the variable levels of neurogenesis
and brain function in the normal and affected brain. The existence of neural progenitor
cells in adult CNS has opened a novel dimension of research to explore the potential of
these cells for treatment of neurological disorders..

The present study is designed to evaluate the effects of natural and synthetic compounds on
neuronal proliferation, maturation, survival and differentiation. This study might help in
discovery of new era in medical science for improving the treatment of various
neuro-degenerative diseases through the mechanism of neurogenesis..

Visual thalamus receives direct inputs from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and is
important for both image-forming and non-image-forming visual functions. Recent studies have
shown that these RGC inputs play important roles in the development of cell types and
circuits in these regions. For example, retinal inputs regulate the long-distance
recruitment of GABAergic interneurons into two regions of visual thalamus – the dorsal and
ventral lateral geniculate nuclei. Our lab recently discovered that these retinal inputs
induce astrocytes to generate fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), a potent motogen that is
essential for interneuron migration into these regions. However, how retinal inputs induce
the astrocytic expression of FGF15 remains unresolved. Here, we tested the role of
RGC-derived Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) in this process since RGCs are known to release SHH in the
brain and SHH is known to induce FGF15 expression in other parts of the embryonic brain.
Using trans-criptomic analysis, in situ hybridization, and reporter line,
we observed that thalamus-projecting RGCs express SHH, and SHH receptors and signaling
pathway components are expressed in the developing visual thalamus. Specifically, we
discovered thalamic astrocytes express Patched-1, Smoothened, and Glioma-associated oncogene
transcription factors. Our data revealed a significant decrease in the thalamic expression
of Fgf15 mRNA and GABAergic interneuron number in the mice lacking SHH
specifically from RGCs, suggesting the importance of this axo-glial signaling pathway in the
development of visual thalamus. Overall, our results shed light on novel ways in which
astrocytes mediate the recruitment of inter-neurons into neonatal visual thalamus..

EXPLORING THE ROLE OF ASTROCYTE SYSTEM XC-IN ACUTE SEIZURE GENERATION AND
EPILEPTOGENESIS

System xc− (Sxc−) is a heteromeric amino acid
antiporter composed of a substrate-specific light chain (xCT) and a heavy chain (4f2hc), the
latter of which tethers it to the plasma membrane. It plays a vital role in maintaining both
intracellular glutathione (via import of cystine) and extracellular glutamate (via export of
glutamate) levels in the brain. Previously, we demonstrated that mice harboring a natural
null mutation in the gene that encodes for xCT (Slc7a11sut/sut), and thus have no
functional Sxc− expression in any of their cells
(Sxc− global null mice), have an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I)
imbalance in brain. Specifically, we found that Slc7a11sut/sut mice are more
excitable (i.e., have lower convulsive seizure thresholds) than their wild type
(Slc7a11+/+) littermates after acute challenge with the chemoconvulsant
pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Despite this, Slc7a11sut/sut mice show behavioral signs
of hypoexcitability following a sub-chronic, sub-convulsant PTZ kindling paradigm. To wit,
the percent of SLC7a11
sut/sut
 mice that kindle — defined as exhibiting a convulsive seizure on three consecutive
days of injection — is significantly lower than their
SLC7a11+/+littermate controls. However,
since system xc− is predominantly expressed in cells known as
astro-cytes in the brain, the goal of this study was to test whether mice with targeted loss
of Sxc− in astrocytes only (astrocyte conditional knockout mice, AcKO)
will recapitulate the results seen in our global null mice. Toward this end, we have begun
to measure the acute seizure and kindling thresholds of AcKO mice in comparison to their
wild-type littermate controls. Preliminary data, to be presented, support a role for
astrocyte Sxc
− in the maintenance of E/I balance in brain. Supported by NINDS R01 NS051445 and

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disabilities characterized
by behavioral impairments and atypical brain connectivity. Imaging studies reported altered
structure of the corpus callosum (CC) in patients. However, the underlying ultrastructural
and cellular changes remain elusive. The valproic acid (VPA) model is a valuable strategy to
study ASD neurobiology. In this model, we have previously demonstrated hypomyelination in
the CC of juvenile VPA rats. As ASD has an early onset, the aim of this work was to compare
the ultrastructural and cellular characteristics of the CC in infant and juvenile VPA rats.
Pregnant Wistar rats were administrated with VPA (450mg/kg) or saline on gestation day 10.5.
At PND15 (infant) and 36 (juvenile), CC ultrastructure and oligo-dendroglial lineage were
evaluated by transmission electron micro-scopy and immunofluorescence, respectively.
Oligodendroglial lineage was studied with PDGFαR (for precursors) and CC1 (for myelinating
oligodendrocytes) markers. The CC of infant VPA rats showed a reduced percentage of
myelinated axons and similar myelin sheath ultrastructure when compared with controls. Both
precursor and mature oligodendrocyte densities were preserved in the CC of infant VPA rats.
The CC of juvenile VPA rats evidenced a reduced percentage of myelinated axons and disturbed
myelin compaction; while oligodendrocyte precursors were increased, mature oligo-dendrocytes
decreased. Our results indicate that myelin alterations are present in the CC of infant VPA
rats, preceding the disturbances in myelin sheath compaction and the disbalance in the
oligodendro-glial lineage observed in juvenile rats. Our work suggests that an impaired
axon-oligodendroglia communication could underlie CC connectivity deficits in ASD..

During development, Schwann cells (SCs) undergo extensive cyto-skeletal reorganization as
they insert cytoplasmic extensions into axon bundles to sort, ensheath, and myelinate
individual axons. Similarly, following peripheral nerve injury there is extensive actin
polymerization around Schmidt-Lantermann incisures (SLIs) as Schwann cells differentiate
into a repair phenotype. Both of these processes are regulated by Rac1. Our laboratory
previously demon-strated that Rac1 activation in SCs is driven by engagement of α6β1
integrin with laminins, and that this is essential for peripheral nerve development. We then
performed a proteomic screen to look for novel Rac1 interactors in peripheral nerves and
identified striatin-3 (Strn3) as a candidate. Strn family proteins (Strn1/3/4) function as
the core scaffolding proteins of STRIPAK (STRiatin-Interacting
Phosphatase
And
Kinase) complexes, which are capable of regulating the Hippo pathway.
Our group previously demonstrated that the downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway,
Yap/Taz, are critical for myelin development. Knockdown of Strn3 in primary rat SCs reduces
proliferation and disrupts their association with axons. Using Strn3 floxed mice expressing
P0-Cre, we have specifically ablated Strn3 in SCs (Strn3SCKO). Sciatic nerves of
Strn3SCKO mice demonstrate mild radial sorting defects and hypomyelination.
Strn3 null SCs isolated from these animals have impaired cell elongation, process extension,
and lamellipodia formation, similar to SCs deficient in Rac1. Our work will investigate
mechanisms linking the STRIPAK complex with Rac1 and the Hippo pathway in SCs. Additionally,
this work seeks to define the role of Strn3 and the STRIPAK complex in SC development and
injury response..

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 1.7-3.7 million people in the US alone every year.
Neurons transmit and receive signals and astro-cytes carry out many homeostatic and
structural functions which are critical to support neurons. Previously, we have demonstrated
that within minutes of mild TBI/ concussion (mTBI), expression of critical homeostatic
proteins including those involved in glutamate and potassium buffering (e.g. Glutamate
transporter 1, Glutamine synthetase, Kir4.1) is reduced. Additionally, there are signs of
early damage to neuronal nuclear protein NeuN, which is a regulator of mRNA splicing. We
hypothesized that early astrocyte dysfunction after mTBI will lead to subsequent neuronal
dysfunction. To test this, we used C57Bl/6J mice of either sex in a model of repeated mTBI.
We used qualitative and quantitative semi-automated analysis to evaluate astrocyte and
neuronal expression in the cortex in mice days, weeks, and up to 6-months post TBI. We
observed Kir4.1 and Glt-1 downregulation at all time points including 6 months after mTBI.
As early as 1-day post-injury, in areas of Glt1 and Kir4.1 downregulation, subsets of
cortical neurons lacked or downregulated NeuN. However, using fluorescent Nissl staining we
found that these neurons are present. Future studies will determine if NeuN-lacking neurons
are functionally impaired..

We previously demonstrated that nicotinamide phos-phoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), a rate
limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD+ biosynthesis, is primarily
expressed in neurons under normal conditions and is brain protective after ischemic stroke
in a mouse model of photothrombosis (PT). In the present study, we showed that NAMPT is
largely upregulated in reactive astrocytes at peri-infarct region (PIR) after PT, suggesting
astrocytic Nampt is a stress responsive gene. To test the role of astro-cytic NAMPT in
neuronal and brain protection, we generated astro-cyte specific NAMPT conditional knockout
(cKO) mice by crossing GFAP-Cre with floxed Nampt (Namptf/f) mice, i.e.,
GFAP-Nampt+/- and GFAP-Nampt−/- cKO mice. When subject to PT, Nampt
cKO mice exhibit significant increases in infarct volume and neuronal death in the PIR as
compared with wild type (WT) mice. Using immunostaining, we further found that the deletion
of Nampt in reactive astrocytes also reduces cell proliferation and reactive astro-gliosis
in the PIR. Overexpression of NAMPT in astrocytes using AAV vector reduced brain infarction
after PT and increased Sox2+ neuronal progenitor cells. Our study thus demonstrate that
astrocytic NAMPT is brain protective and contributes to reactive gliosis and cell
proliferation in focal ischemic stroke..

Glutamate (Glu), the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, activates a
wide variety of signal transduction cascades involved in the regulation of protein
synthesis. Although protein translation is an exquisitely regulated process, translational
dysregulation has been observed in many neurodegenerative disorders. Manganese (Mn) is an
essential trace element, that in high doses exerts serious oxidative and neurotoxic effects.
An established consequence of Mn neurotoxicity is the disruption of the glutamate/ glutamine
(Glu/Gln) cycle, leading to an excitotoxic insult. The molecular mechanisms mediating
Mn-induced neurotoxicity, particularly in the context of the Glu/Gln cycle, are not yet
fully understood. Hence, we decided to investigate the effect of Mn short-term exposure in
signaling pathways involved in protein synthesis, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase
(PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) cascade that regulates the Glu/Gln shuttle. To this end, we
decided to use Bergmann glial cells (BGC) primary cultures, a well-established model of
glial/neuronal interactions. Confluent BGC monolayers were exposed to MnCl2
50-500 µM for different periods and the phosphorylation patterns of Akt, the eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), as well as the AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK), were measured. A time and dose-dependent increase in the
phosphorylation status of these proteins was found. An increase in Akt phosphorylation was
observed as early as 5 min in a concentration-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition
of PI3K and the sodium/calcium exchanger blocked these effects. Furthermore, Mn treatment
augmented 4E-BP1 phos-phorylation up to 15 min of exposure, and this effect was depleted by
inhibition of mTORC1. The Mn-induced increase of AMPK phos-phorylation suggests that Mn
could exert a biphasic effect in protein synthesis that might be linked to a reduction in
ATP levels and the resulting change in the protein repertoire of these cells. These findings
strengthen the idea of the critical role that glial cells have in neurotoxicity
development..

Astrocytes comprise a highly complex cell population with diverse structural and functional
properties in both the healthy and diseased central nervous system. Astrocytic pathology has
been implicated in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, however, their structural
rearrangement in brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain poorly understood.
Here, we applied super-resolution imaging and 3-dimensional (3D) electron microscopy
approaches to better understand the structural changes of astrocytes in AD model (hAPP/ PS1)
mice. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) of genetically-labeled astrocytes allowed us
to capture global modifications to individual astrocyte shape while resolving certain
aspects of their subcellular organelle distribution. We observed perturbations to the
complex branching pattern of whole astrocytes and additionally, mapped the organization of
mitochondria throughout the cell in AD model samples. Results from SIM imaging were
complemented with analysis using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM)
that enabled 3D serial reconstruction of astrocyte ultrastructure. Using FIB-SEM, we found
dramatic restructuring of astrocyte subcompartments in neuropil and astrocytic endfeet,
including major alterations of astrocytic process shape and the restructuring/redistribution
of mitochondria. Quantitative analysis of SIM and FIB-SEM approaches allowed us to directly
compare the astrocytic surface structure and the organelle distribution/ morphology within
astrocyte sub-compartments using custom MATLAB scripts, in healthy and AD model tissue. This
multi-level structural analysis of astrocytes provides an important understanding of how
astrocytes are constructed in the healthy brain and altered with brain disease..

The etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains largely unknown but it is now clear that
both genetic and environmental factors play a role. A major factor contributing to the
environmental component is the microbiome which can influence disease progression in a
variety of autoimmune diseases. While changes in the gut microbiome have been most often
characterized, changes in the oral biome, a more easily accessible source, are limited. In
the current study we examined the oral microbiome in a pair of monozygotic twins discordant
for MS to minimize the genetic contribution to disease. One twin (MSF1) had clinically
definite MS; the second (MSF2) was diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome. Shot-gun
sequencing of DNA isolated from saliva was mapped to the NCBI non-redundant DNA database,
and identified 7,418 unique bacterial species in the twins. Taxonomic analysis shows that
the relative abundance of 3 phyla were higher, and 3 were lower in MSF1 compared to MSF2. Of
the 26 species that were present at 1% or greater abundance, 8 were higher in MSF1 compared
to MSF2. Pathway analysis identified 116 level 3 BRITE (Bright Target Explorer) functional
hierarchies that differed by at least 50% between twins, of which 21 were present at 0.005%
or greater abundance. These data demonstrate differences in the oral biome of MS patients
with distinct disease severity, suggesting that oral biome analysis may be useful for
diagnostic use or assessment of therapeutic interventions. This work was supported by grants

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of global concern, imposing an
estimated cost of $52 billion per year in the United States, alone. The pathological
hallmarks of PD include debilitating motor deficits, driven by progressive degeneration of
dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway, an essential circuit for motor function.
Emerging evidence suggests that neuroin-flammation is a key player in the pathophysiology of
this degenerative process. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the central
nervous system (CNS), where they serve diverse homeo-static functions. However, following
inflammatory stimulation, astro-cytes enter a reactive state that can be neurotoxic,
resulting in neu-ronal cell death. Numerous studies have now revealed that reactive
astrocytes can contribute to clinical neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism
through which homeostatic astrocytes become reactive requires further investigation. We have
identified damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by neurons undergoing cell
death as potential drivers of inflammatory astrocyte activation. DAMPs are important “alarm”
molecules that initiate several downstream inflammatory responses. Recent work from our
laboratory and others has identified receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) as a
central mediator of neuroinflammation. Here, we show that DAMPs activate RIPK3 signaling in
astrocytes, resulting in inflammatory astrocyte activation, followed by neuro-toxic effects
and neuron loss in the midbrain. Together, these experiments identify novel mechanisms of
neurotoxic astrocyte activation with implications for the pathophysiology of PD..

DIABETIC RETINA

Diabetic retinopathy (DR), an incurable eye disease caused by prolonged high
glucose levels in the retina, is a leading complication of diabetes mellitus and the leading
cause of blindness amongst working age adults. Prolonged high glucose levels damage retinal
blood vessels leading to hemorrhages, ischemia and ultimately vision loss. Microglia, the
resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are believed to contribute to the
development of DR as they are rapidly activated and respond to transient hyperglycemia, and
reset the homeostatic threshold of the retina. As prolonged hyperglycemia persists,
micro-angiography occurs resulting in serum proteins and DAMPs from the periphery leaking
into the retina. This results in microgliosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
Altogether, the peripheral components and microglia-mediated inflammation due to
hyperglycemia results in angiogenesis and vascular damage, microglial clustering around
vascular lesions, fibrinogen leakage, and further up-regulation of proinflammatory mediators
in the diabetic retina. Therefore, to understand the role of microglia in DR progression we
depleted microglia to determine if strategies to downregulate microglia mediated
inflammation serves clinically relevant to prevent neuronal damage and hence vision loss.
Utilizing a genetic model using mice expressing an inducible Cre under the
CX3CR1 promoter and the DTR gene under the Rosa 26 promoter
(CX3CR1CreER:R26iDTR), expression of DTR by CX3CR1-
expressing cells only occurs upon tamoxifen (TAM) treatment, rendering microglia susceptible
to the effects of diphtheria toxin (DTx). The overall goal of this study was to determine if
the removal of reactive microglia in the diabetic retina will ameliorate vascular damage,
fibrinogen deposition, and the neuronal degeneration that give rise to the robust
neuroinflammation and retinal degradation in the diabetic murine retina. Our findings
revealed that transient depletion of CX3CR1CreER:R26iDTR microglia
during the course of disease when microglia receive the early-stage environmental cues of
retinal inflammation due to hyperglycemia, induced neuroprotective cues to upregulate Tuj1
+
neurons in the diabetic retina..

The use of transplanted neural stem cells (NSC) to treat neuro-degenerative conditions such
as spinal cord injury (SCI) holds exciting potential. However, the complex interactions
between NSC and their microenvironment must be better understood to ensure the transplanted
cells develop and integrate properly in the host CNS. A critical component of understanding
how NSC communicate with their microenvironment is elucidating mechanisms of neuroimmune
signaling. We have shown that the complement cascade, part of the innate immune system, has
non-traditional roles in signaling to trans-planted NSC. Particularly, C1q, the recognition
molecule of the classical cascade, signals to NSC and affects NSC migration, pro-liferation,
and differentiation both in vitro and in an in vivo SCI model. Critically,
SCI involves disruption of the blood spinal-cord barrier occurs with an acute, robust influx
of serum proteins, including C1q. We have published data showing that this influx of C1q
serves as chemoattractant to NSC, causing them to migrate towards the injury epicenter.
Recruited NSC then add to the astroglial scar, and fail to contribute to the animal's
locomotor recovery. Here, we identify a novel C1q receptor expressed by NSC, and show that
it specifically mediates the chemotactic effects of C1q on NSC. Using receptor-knockout NSC,
we found that receptor expression is required for C1q-induced chemotaxis, and. Investigating
the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways through which this chemo-taxis occurs, may
elucidate the in vivo relevance of these findings and allow for the
development of strategies to control NSC migration in a therapeutic context, potentially
expanding the clinical SCI trans-plantation window..

Increasing blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage has been correlated with the progression of
long-term neurological deficits but the underlying mechanisms that occur after BBB leakage
in concussive traumatic brain injury (TBI) have not been revealed. In a mouse model of
concussive TBI, we observed downregulation of nearly all astrocytic proteins, including
those involved in brain homeostasis and astrogliosis as early as 10 minutes. This response
is sustained for several months, presenting a major challenge for normal brain function.
Notably, these areas with atypical astrocytes overlapped with areas of BBB leakage. This
suggests that the leakage of blood-borne factors triggers atypical astrocytes after
concussive TBI. To test the hypothesis that leakage of blood-borne factors induces atypical
astrocytes after concussive TBI, we chose two approaches: 1) a genetic approach
ablating some endothelial cells in the adult mouse brain to enable BBB leakage in the
absence of mechanical injury to determine if exposure to blood-borne factors is sufficient
to cause atypical astrocytes. I observed Glt1 downregulation in the cortex six hours after
induced BBB damage. 2) Screening of blood-borne factors was performed using cultures from
postnatal day 3-5 C57B/6 mouse pups maintained in serum-free media for seven days or 14
days. While there were no significant changes in Glt-1 and Kir4.1 expression 2h after plasma
treatment, 24h plasma treatment reduced both proteins in cultures maintained in media for
seven days. Also, 24h plasma treatment reduced expression of both proteins in cultures
maintained in media for 14 days. To determine if the responsible blood-borne factors are
proteins or immune cells, I heat-denature the plasma before treating the cultures and found
that Glt-1 and Kir4.1 were rescued. Overall, my data suggest that blood-borne proteins or
immune cells cause atypical astrocytes..

STROKE

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability. Neuroinflammation
after stroke can significantly affect stroke outcomes–it can induce tissue repair but also
exacerbate cell death. In the acute period after stroke, microglia and astrocytes enter a
reactive state of gliosis. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, are the major
producers of inflammatory molecules in the hours following stroke but also have
neuroprotective functions such as clearance of harmful debris and release of
anti-inflammatory factors. Similarly, astrocytes release pro-inflammatory cytokines but also
mediate neuroprotection through the formation of the astrocytic scar surrounding the infarct
core. However, the exact astrocytic and microglial signaling pathways regulating
neuroinflammation after stroke are unresolved. A barrier to understanding this has been the
challenge of parsing the astrocytic and microglial response from that of infiltrating
inflammatory cell types in the brain after stroke. To address this, we used the RiboTag
technique to separately obtain astrocyte and microglia-derived transcripts after stroke. By
crossing the RiboTag with Aldh1l1-CreER or Cx3cr1-CreER mice, we expressed a hemagglutinin
tag on ribosomes only in astrocytes or microglia, respectively. This enables
immunoprecipitation and isolation of astrocytic and microglial ribosomes with their attached
actively translating mRNAs. We performed RNA-sequencing on astrocyte or microglia-specific
transcripts obtained from male and female mice 3 days after distal middle cerebral artery
occlusion or sham surgery. In astrocytes, we found 1891 genes were upregulated and 46 genes
were downregulated between stroke and sham animals. In microglia, we found 1048 genes were
upregulated and 753 genes were downregulated between stroke and sham animals. Of note, many
of the genes upregulated in both microglia and astrocytes at this time point are involved in
immune cell recruitment and activation, suggesting microglia and astrocytes are particularly
involved in attracting peripheral immune cells to the injury site at this time point. Using
this technique, we will comprehensively define the astrocyte and microglia specific
translatome response in the acute period after stroke..

Nickel (Ni) is a ubiquitous metal in the environment with increasing industrial
application. While environmental and occupational exposure to Ni compounds has been known to
result in toxicities to several organs, including liver, kidney, lungs, skin, and gonads,
neurotoxic effects have not been extensively investigated. In this present study, we
investigated specific neuronal susceptibility in a C. elegans model of
acute Ni neurotoxicity. Wild-type worms and worms expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)
in either cholinergic, dopaminergic or GABAergic neurons were treated with NiCl2
for 1h at the first larval (L1) stage. The median lethal dose (LD50) was
calculated to be 5.88 mM in this paradigm. Morphology studies of GFP-expressing worms showed
significantly increasing degeneration of cholinergic, dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons
with increasing Ni concentration. Significant functional changes in locomotion and basal
slowing response assays reflected that cholinergic and dopaminergic neuronal function,
respectively, were impaired due to Ni treatment. Interestingly, a small but significant
number of worms exhibited shrinker phenotype upon Ni exposure but no loopy head foraging
behaviour was observed suggesting that function of D-type GABAergic neurons of C elegans may
be specifically attenuated while the RME subset of GABAergic neurons are not. GFP expression
due to induction of glutathione S-transferase 4 (gst-4), a target of Nrf2
homolog skn-1, was increased in a P
gst-4
::GFP worm highlighting Ni-induced oxidative stress. RT-qPCR verified upregulation of
this expression of gst-4 immediately after exposure. These data suggest
that oxidative stress is associated with neuronal damage and altered behaviour due to
developmental Ni exposure..

Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the
NAD+ salvage pathway. Our previous study demonstrated that deletion of NAMPT
gene in projection neurons using Thy1-NAMPT−/−conditional knockout (cKO) mice
causes neu-ronal degeneration, muscle atrophy, neuromuscular junction abnormalities,
paralysis and eventually death. Here we conducted a combined metabolomic and transcriptional
profiling study in vivo in an attempt to further investigate the mechanism of neuronal
degeneration at metabolite and mRNA levels after NAMPT deletion. Here using steady-state
metabolomics, we demonstrate that deletion of NAMPT causes a significant decrease of
NAD+ metabolome and bio-energetics, a buildup of metabolic intermediates
upstream of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in glycolysis, and an increase
of oxidative stress. RNA-seq shows that NAMPT deletion leads to the increase of mRNA levels
of enzymes in NAD metabolism, in particular PARP family of NAD+ consumption
enzymes, as well as glycolytic genes Glut1, Hk2 and PFBFK3 before GAPDH. GO, KEGG and GSEA
analyses show the activations of apoptosis, inflammation and immune responsive pathways and
the inhibition of neuronal/synaptic function in the cKO mice. The current study suggests
that increased oxidative stress, apoptosis and neuroin-flammation contribute to
neurodegeneration and mouse death as a direct consequence of bioenergetic stress after NAMPT
deletion..

PATHWAY

Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system, undergo massive
metabolic changes during myelin synthesis - a single oligodendrocyte can produce over 500
times its soma surface area in myelin. This massive lipid and protein synthesis creates
harmful byproducts like hydrogen peroxide, leading to oxi-dative stress and damage if not
managed. The mechanisms by which oligodendrocytes cope with the unique metabolic demands of
mye-lination remain unknown; in fact, oligodendrocytes have been shown to have low tolerance
for oxidative stress, attributed to high iron concentrations and low antioxidant activity.
However previous work from our lab has shown that GSTpi, a protein that catalyzes
anti-oxidant reactions by glutathione, is highly expressed in juvenile, but not adult,
oligodendrocytes. Notably, the juvenile period is the peak of developmental myelination in
mice - one possibility is that active myelination is a period of transient antioxidant
activity that offsets the metabolic stress of lipid and protein synthesis. To test this
hypo-thesis, we analyzed the glutathione pathway in the oligodendrocytes of juvenile
(P21-P25) and adult mice (P60-90) by qPCR and immunohistochemistry, and found that the
glutathione pathway is upregulated during juvenile development. In vitro,
we found that inducing antioxidant signaling by melatonin increased oligodendro-cyte
differentiation; surprisingly, oxidative treatments (H2O2 and buthione
sulfoximine) similarly increased differentiation at sublethal doses, indicating that paired
oxidation and antioxidant function may be required during oligodendrocyte development.
Additional time course experiments will determine when oligodendrocytes are most sensitive
to oxidative and antioxidative treatments. Together, these results indicate that glutathione
signaling may play an important role during oligodendrocyte development, and may underly
juvenile white matter's resistance to ischemic injury..

Astrocytes provide diverse support for brain function by maintaining essential interactions
with endothelial cells to form the BBB. Pathological astrocyte-BBB interactions contribute
to ischemic stroke, which is the 5th leading cause of death in the US. However,
the mechanisms underlying maintenance of BBB integrity both in health and diseases such as
stroke remain poorly defined. our study focuses on an astrocyte-enriched sodium-bicarbonate
cotransporter, Slc4a4, which was previously identified as an astrocyte-specific regulator of
both intracellular and extracellular pH. While pH homeostasis is essential for metabolic
activity in the brain, the role of Slc4a4 in astrocyte-BBB integrity remains unknown. To
address the role of Slc4a4 in this context, we generated new transgenic mouse lines that
temporally ablate Slc4a4 in astrocytes. Using this genetic mouse model, we show loss of
Slc4a4 in adult significantly dampens astrocyte endfeet Ca2+ signaling and
generates enlarged blood vessels with disrupted endothelial junctions. Combination of
transcriptome, proteomic and metabolomic profiling of Slc4a4-ablated astrocytes and
conditioned media (CM) of Slc4a4-ablated astrocytes reveal dysregulation of genes associated
with vasculature-BBB maintenance, inflammatory chemo-cytokines, and glial metabolism,
further supporting a crucial role for Slc4a4 in BBB integrity by governing
astrocyte-endothelia cell crosstalk. Among differentially expressed genes associated with
Slc4a4 deletion, we confirm the upregulation of Ccl2 (C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2) in the
CM of Slc4a4-ablated astrocytes and Slc4a4-deficient brain. We further validate the
Slc4a4-Ccl2 axis using in vitro BBB model and find that blocking Ccl2
pathway restores endothelial junction and permeability. Using a mouse model of stroke, we
found loss of Slc4a4 exacerbates stroke-induced motor dysfunction, mortality and BBB
disruption coupled with impaired reactive gliosis. Together, our study indicates the
indispensable role of Slc4a4 mediated astrocyte-BBB interaction, providing insights for the
potential of glia metabolism regulators as novel therapeutic approach for BBB-related CNS
disorders..

Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inactivates vasoactive p450 derived polyunsaturated fatty
acid epoxides, converting them into cytotoxic diols. We found that the ratios of linoleic
acid (LA) diols to epoxides were associated with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SVD)
in patients with transient ischemic attack; however, the roles of these oxylipins remain
unclear in clinical stroke of large or small vessel lacunar aetiology. Patients from ONDRI
with clinical stroke of either large or small vessel etiology were included. Four plasma LA
oxylipins (12,13-dihydroxyoctadecamonoenoic acid (12,13- DiHOME), 12,13-epoxyoctadecenoic
acid (12,13-EpOME), 9,10-DiHOME, 9,10-EpOME) were measured with UPLC/MS-MS. White matter
hyperintensities (WMH; an SVD marker) were quantified from structural MRI using Lesion
Explorer. Cerebral free water (resultant from vasogenic edema or neurodegeneration) was
calculated from diffusion tensor imaging. Among 80 stroke patients (n=50 large vessel
occlusion, n=30 lacunar infarcts), the ratio of 12,13-DiHOME to its epoxide sEH substrate
12,13-EpOME was higher among patients with lacunar stroke (F1,78=5.06,
p=0.028)..

Controlling for age, sex, hyperlipidemia, waist hip ratio, and fasting glucose, the 12,13
oxylipin ratio, and the 9,10 oxylipin ratio were positively associated with volumes of deep
(β=0.335, p=0.005; β=0.288, p=0.012, respectively) and periventricular (β=0.331, p=0.002;
β=0.404, p<0.001, respectively) WMH. In the lacunar stroke subgroup, the 12,13-ratio was
associated with white matter free water volume (β=0.339, p=0.027). Oxylipins derived from
sEH activity may contribute to clinical stroke of small vessel etiology, potentially via
blood brain barrier disruption and vasogenic edema..

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health issue that affects disproportionally females.
AD is a neurodegenerative disorder of gray matter, characterized by synaptic loss, neuronal
death, and the presence of neurofibrillary tangles. White matter (WM) lesions observed in
elderly subjects increase the vulnerability of WM to injury, such as ischemic stroke.
Increasing evidence has revealed a connection between WM changes (WMCs) and the
pathophysiology of AD. Interestingly, human patients and studies from animal models of AD
suggest that WM dysfunction precedes AD pathology. However, direct assessments of WM
function in AD have not been documented. Because AD generally associates with aging brain,
it is important to distinguish age-related changes from neurodegenerative pathophysiology.
Using Tg2576, a well-established AD mouse model that overexpressed human APP, we
investigated axon function properties and the response to metabolic challenges with respect
to age..

Isolated mouse optic nerves (MONs), a pure myelinated WM tract, were obtained from female
Tg2576+ mice and age-match littermate controls at 7 and 18 months old. Axon
function was quantified as area under the evoked compound action potentials. Ischemia was
induced by switching to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 1h, followed by five hours
recovery. Under baseline conditions, axon conduction properties and excitability remained
the same among the different groups. Young Tg2576+ females showed a similar
recovery to control female group after OGD. There was a robust effect of aging among control
females such that aging group recovered substantially less compared to young control group.
However, unexpectedly, aging Tg2576+ females recovered similar to young
Tg2576+ group. Correspondingly, aging Tg2576+ females recovered
better than aging control females suggesting that Tg2576+ aged females do not
have impaired axon function..

In conclusion, unexpectedly, Tg2576 aging females were less affected by ischemic injury
compared to aged control females. A potential explanation for this resilience against
ischemic injury could be alternative cleavage of APP or compensatory mechanisms in WM that
might need further investigation..
