C.1.2,"For instance, the Delta mutant discovered in October 2020 in India, with its strong transmissibility and basic features of immune escape, has gradually become the most important strain in new cases around the world, reducing the efficacy of immunizations significantly (12, 13); the new South African variety C.1.2, with 41.8 mutations, may be more infectious than the others..",PMC9095899
