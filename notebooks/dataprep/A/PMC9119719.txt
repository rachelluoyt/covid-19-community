: Using whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to identify variants circulating in DRC and obtaining molecular information useful for diagnosis, improving treatment and general pandemic control strategies..

: Seventy-four SARS-CoV-2 isolates were sequenced using Oxford Nanopore platforms. Generated reads were processed to obtain consensus genome sequences. Sequences with over 80% genome coverage were used for variant calling, phylogenetic analysis and classification using pangolin lineage annotation nomenclature..

: Phylogenetic analysis based on Pangolin classification clustered South Kivu sequences into seven lineages (A.23.1, B.1.1.6, B.1.214, B.1.617.2, B.1.351, C.16 and P.1). The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant was the most dominant and responsible for outbreaks during the third wave. Based on Wuhan reference genome a total of 289 distinct mutations were detected including 141 missenses, 123 synonymous and 25 insertions/deletions when our isolates were mapped to Wuhan reference strain. The majority of these point mutations were located within the coding sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that includes Spike, ORF1ab, ORF3, and nucleocapsid protein (N) genes. The most common mutation was D614G (1841A>G) observed in 61 sequences followed by L4715L (14143C>T) found in 60 sequences..

: Our findings highlight multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into South Kivu through different sources and subsequent circulation of variants in the province. These results emphasize the importance of timely monitoring of genetic variation and its effect on disease severity. This work set a foundation for the use of genomic surveillance as a tool for future global pandemic management and control..

Introduction.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) that emerged from China in December 2019 and has spread worldwide including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) causing a global pandemic of unprecedented proportion in the recent past. The adequate clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the lung causing flu-like syndrome with clinical signs such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty in breathing (Zou et al., 2020; Ruzzenenti et al., 2021)..

Although the pandemic continues, up until now (February 08th 2022), this virus has infected more than 400 million people with more than 5.7 million deaths worldwide (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, the Betacoronavirus genus, and it is among the largest single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. SARS-CoV-2 genome is ∼30Kb in length, consisting of 10 open reading frames (ORFs) that codes for ORF1ab polyproteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and other accessory proteins (Tai et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Bar-On et al., 2020). Among the genes, S glycoprotein plays essential roles in virus attachment, fusion, and entry into the host cell by binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Tai et al., 2020) and eliciting protective humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in hosts during infection (Belouzard et al., 2012; Amanat et al., 2020)..

To date, SARS-CoV-2 isolates have been classified into eleven clades based on GISAID nomenclature. These clades include L (the clade to which the Wuhan reference strain belongs), S, V, G, GH, GK, GR, GV, O, S and V (Hamed et al., 2021)..

The first COVID-19 case was reported in DRC on March the 10th, 2020, in Kinshasa the capital city (WHO, 2020). Since then, the disease has spread rapidly across the country including South Kivu Province and as expected, outbreak dynamics differ among provinces..

Subsequently, a countrywide partial lockdown that led to schools, and international boundaries closures was imposed by the government from April 2020 to August 2020. Despite, the enforcement of these preventive measures, the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths continued to increase. This led to the first wave of local transmission between March and August 2020. The partial lockdown was vacated where schools and other activities resumed from September 2020. However, in December 2020, another wave of COVID-19 infection hit the country, peaking in February-March 2021. As a result, new containment measures such as curfew, closing of school and abolition of social gatherings, mandatory wearing of face masks as well as proof of a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for international travelers upon arrival were enforced..

Similarly, from June to September 2021, an exponential increase of COVID-19 cases were reported across the country; this culminated in to the third wave of infection. The situation deteriorated very fast particularly in South Kivu province where cases quadrupled, compared to previous waves where an average of 30 cases were reported per week. In the third wave, up to 320 infection cases and ∼10 deaths per week were reported. This placed the South Kivu among the top four provinces that were most affected by COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 2712 infection cases and 58 deaths were recorded in South Kivu by January the 14th 2022, out of a total of 83194 cases and 1086 deaths reported countrywide. Variability was observed within and between waves in number of infected people and the severity of the disease in affected patients. This may indicate variant strains that may be in circulation..

Genomic surveillance is an important tool for global epidemic control by enabling monitoring, evolution, tracking the spread and investigating multiple introductions of the virus (Fraser et al., 2009; Gardy et al., 2018; Holshue et al., 2020). To understand SARS-CoV-2, transmission dynamics and circulating variants, whole-genome sequencing has proven to be a critical epidemiological tool..

To date, few studies on genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Congolese population have been reported and the little available information is restricted to Kinshasa, the capital city of the country. However, no information is available on SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the eastern part of DRC..

South Kivu province is of special interest owing to its geographical location. It borders several countries including Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania. The Province consists of a mixed population from different countries bordering DRC and may favor the introduction and circulation of different SARS-CoV-2 lineages. This study reports the complete genome sequences and phylogenetic analysis of seventy-four SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the first, second and third waves of the epidemic in South Kivu province, East of DRC..

Materials and methods.


Sample collection
.

A total of 130 nasopharyngeal swab samples were selected from SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (from the first, second and third waves) at the Molecular Biology Laboratory of the Université Evangélique en Afrique, DRC. Testing was performed following a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method. The samples were collected in different hospitals in Bukavu city from April 2020 to September 2021 and from travelers crossing different border points between Rwanda and DRC during the same period. The nasopharyngeal samples were collected in a 5ml tube containing 2 ml of Sample Storage buffer (Ansure, Biotechnology) composed of 0.9% of normal saline raisin. The sample selection criterion for whole genome sequencing was based on high viral load predicted by the low cycle threshold (Ct) values of ≤ 25 on real-time RT-PCR analysis..


RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
.

The viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA library was constructed using FIREScript® RT cDNA synthesis KIT (Solis, Biodyne, Italie) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1µl of the total RNA was added into 5µl of the 5x cDNA synthesis mix containing 1µl of SOLIScript Reverse Transcriptase, 0.5ul of RiboFrip RNase Inhibitor, 2µl of 10x RT Reaction Buffer with 10mM DTT, 1µl of random hexamers primers and 0.5µl dNTP mix. The volume was brought up to 20µl with nuclease-free water..

The reactions were incubated for 10 min at 25°C followed by 30 min at 60°C for reverse transcription and 5 min at 85°C for enzyme activation. These steps were carried out in a thermocycler machine (ProFlex, PCR system, Applied Biosystems). The cDNA samples obtained were then stored at −20°C until further use..


Next-generation sequencing and Genome assembly
.

Library preparation and high throughput genomic sequencing was performed at the ILRI Genomic Platform (Nairobi, Kenya). SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing was carried out as described previously (Gohl et al., 2020). Briefly, viral RNA extraction was performed using TANBead® Maelstrom 9600 (Taiwan Advanced Nanotech Inc, Taiwan) automated nucleic acid extractor following the manufacturer's directions. RNA was eluted in 60µl buffer and stored in RNAse-free Eppendorf tubes. The ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 Library Prep Kit (ONT®) were used follozing workflows for Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) (Grubaugh et al., 2019). ONT sequencing was done on the MinION platform. Basecalling, demultiplexing, and adapter trimming were performed using Guppy v5.0.11 and fastq outputs used for downstream analyses. From the 130 sequenced samples only 74 were considered for the downstream analysis, and 56 sequences were removed as we could assemble only 70% to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome..

Variant calling and lineage/clade assignment were carried out using the singularity container of the nf-core/viralrecon v2.2: an analysis pipeline for assembly and intra-host/low-frequency variant calling for viral samples (https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/releases). Read mapping and consensus generation were done by minimap2, and medaka was employed for mutation calling, The snpEff was used for mutation annotation. Pangolin USHER was used further downstream in the analysis of consensus sequences for lineage assignments based on parsimony and Nextclade (Hadfield et al., 2018) for clade specification. The sequence statistics generated from this study are presented in supplementary material Table 1..


Phylogenetic analysis
.

A total of 399 SARS-CoV-2 reference sequences subsampled by Nextstrain were retrieved from NCBI and included in the analysis. These genome sequences were filtered to remove sequences with no metadata and those with greater than 1% of ambiguous bases and partial genomes of less than 80% genome coverage. The subsampling of the reference genomes was done using nextrain's command-line Augur filter tool based on an already subsampled dataset of 2867 that were evenly distributed across time and geography. Our subsampling ensured that we include only genomes with key metadata such as pangolin lineages, sampled before August 31st 2021, from a human host and further probabilistic sampling to minimise any bias. The tree was generated through nextclades's command line workflow and visualised using a local Auspice installation. The nexus tree was downloaded and further edited in figtree tool. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using IQtree/1.6.8 with 1000 bootstrap iterations. The tree was further visualized with FigTree/1.4.4. SARS-CoV-2 pangolineages were assigned using pangolin 3.1.14 (pangoLEARN version 2021-10-13). Nextclade CLI 1.4.2 tool (Aksamentov, 2021) was used to assign SARS-CoV-2 “Nextstrain clades” to the genomes based on pre-determined mutations..

Clinical characteristics of the 74 tested patients and Pango lineage distribution
.

A total of fifty-seven samples (77%) were from male patients within the age range of 31 to 50 years (51.3%). Most patients presented severe symptoms at admission (fever, headache, cough, difficulty in breathing, dyspnea) (n=38(51.3%)) followed by asymptomatic cases (n=31(41.9%)). Diabetes was the major chronic comorbidity presenting in 33(44.6%) patients followed by hypertension in 21(28.3%) patients (Table 1

Demography and clinical characteristics of patients according to Pangolin nomenclature.

Based on the identified mutation profiles, the Nextclade analysis clustered the sequences in four main PANGO lineages. The B.617.2 was the most prevalent (34 sequences) followed by B.1.214.2 with 29 sequences then A.23.1 having nine sequences. The B.1351 lineage had only two sequences. The majority of sequences belonging to the PANGO lineage B.617.2 were from male patients (n=26(74.5%)) within the age range of 31-50 years (n=19(55.9%)). Most of the patients in this category presented severe symptoms (n=20(58.8%)) with 14(41.2%) having diabetes and the majority were admitted in hospitals (n=17(50%)). Similarly, B.1.214.2 lineage comprised of 19(65.5%) samples from female patients and 10(34.5%) samples from male patients. The majority were young patients within the age range of 31-50years (n=18(62%)), over half asymptomatic (n=16(55.2%)), and more than half (n=15(51.2%)) were diabetic. Interestingly, 20(68.9%) of these patients were admitted in hospitals. Demographic and epidemiological characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 categorized by the PANGO nomenclature are summarized in Table 1..


Phylogenetic analysis
.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of two major SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VoC) circulating in South Kivu, DRC. The two main variants were Delta (B.1.617.2) with its two sub-lineages (AY.33 and AY.39) detected in 36 samples from the third wave and Beta (B.1.351) identified in two sequences from the first and second wave. The lineages mentioned in this line are not considered VOI by WHO. In addition, two Variants of Interest (VoI) including A.23.1 and B.1.214 were identified. According to PANGOLIN website report, the B.1.214 was primarily associated with DRC and the neighboring countries while A.23.1 was responsible for most of the infection in Uganda. The finding most likely indicates local and imported transmission events of SARS-CoV-2 in the South Kivu metropolitan area (Figure 1
). Furthermore, one sequence classified as C.16 was detected in an infected patient in November 2020 during the second wave.Figure 1Phylogenetic tree comparing the seventy-four Congolese SARS-CoV-2 sequences with 399 previously published whole genome sequences.

Pango lineage distribution
.

PANGOLIN analysis revealed that most sequences (n=26(35.1%)) belonged to Pango lineage B.1.214.2, which was the major lineage responsible for epidemics during the first and second waves of infection in DRC. The second most common Pango lineage was B.1.617.2 found in 19 sequences (25.7%) and its subvariant AY.33 identified in 10 sequences (13.5%) constituting the major drivers of Covid-19 epidemics during the third wave of infection. In addition, lineage B.1 was detected in 3(4%) samples, while B.1.223 and C.16 were detected in one patient each and were associated with epidemics during the first wave. Pango Lineages assigned to the sequences and countries where most of the lineages have been reported are presented in Table 2

Mutational dimension
.

Our analysis identified a total of 289 distinct mutations in our data. These mutations included 141 missense mutations, 123 synonymous mutations and 25 INDELS. The majority of the mutations were in the ORF1ab gene (170), followed by the Spike (S) gene with 49 mutations, the N gene with 22 mutations, and the ORF10 gene had only two mutations (Table 3
). Of the missense mutations, 71 were identified in ORF1ab the longest ORF of SARS-CoV-2 covering roughly two-thirds of the entire genome. Spike gene had 31 missense mutations. Similarly, the majority (90) of synonymous mutations were found in the ORF1ab, followed by 12 synonymous mutations located in the Spike region.Table 3Number of mutations observed in coding regionsTable 3Genome regionMutation typesMissenseSynonymousInsertion/deletionTotalORF1ab71909170S3112649E2114ORF3a132116ORF7a4206ORF83249ORF101102M47011N126422Total14112325289.

Discussion.

A genome constitutes the molecular architecture of any living organism and encodes its phenotypic and genotypic make-up. Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome play a vital role in the virus genome transmission, replication efficiency, pathogenicity, and virulence for its human host (Maitra et al., 2020). The present study describes molecular characteristics and analysis of the mutation pattern of full-length SARS-CoV-2 strains responsible for COVID-19 epidemics in South Kivu province, DRC, from December 2020 to July 2021. We have elucidated the circulating variants and possible resultant effects of mutations identified in infected individuals..

In the current study, Pango analysis of 74 samples clustered the SARS-CoV-2 sequences in 4 main Pangolin lineages with the most prevalent being the B.1.617.2 primarily identified in young male individuals as well as A.23.1 and B.1.351 (VOC). A previous studies conducted in Rwanda (Butera et al., 2021) and Uganda (Bugembe et al., 2021) reported the sub-lineage A.23.1 that is currently dominating and detection of lineage B.1.315 among incoming travelers..

Our analyses show that most of tested samples were from diabetic patients and about a quarter were from hypertensive individuals. These findings corroborate with previous studies suggesting that comorbidities play a significant role in COVID-19 disease severity (Goyal et al., 2020; Richardson et al., 2020). The B.1.617.2 was primarily detected mostly in patients with severe symptoms and the majority were admitted in hospitals. This finding is in line with previous studies that demonstrated that patients with the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 are more than twice as likely to be admitted to hospital than those infected with the alpha or gamma variants (Wise, 2021; Twohig et al., 2021)..

The Pango lineage classification was used to identify the major lineages circulating in South Kivu as this nomenclature system is designed to combine both genetic and geographical information about SARS-CoV-2 dynamics (O'Toole et al., 2021)..

Thus, the comparisons based on phylogenetic analysis entailed 399 genomes retrieved from the GISAID database. Our analysis revealed the circulation of two main variants that include Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variant with its two sub-lineages (AY.33 and AY.39) responsible for most of the COVID-19 outbreaks during the third wave (May-end July 2021). The third wave was characterized by an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths in DRC particularly in South Kivu compared to the previous waves where an average of 320 cases and 10 deaths were recorded daily. The Delta reportedly originated from the state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and spread throughout India (Mlcochova et al., 2021)..

The Delta variant spread throughout DRC and led to more severe disease symptoms in the local population with many hospitalization cases. This is in line with previous studies showing the Delta variant to be the most dominant strain worldwide, more transmissible and presenting a higher risk of hospitalization and mortality (Callaway, 2021; Despress et al., 2021). Delta variant was declared a variant of concern due to this characteristic (Singh et al. 2021)..

In addition, the Beta (B.1.351) variant was also responsible for outbreaks during the first and second waves in South Kivu. The presence of the Beta variant was first reported in India during December 2020 before it spreads in Africa particularly in South Africa with 8,664,388 cases reported in the continent. This variant was associated with in-hospital mortality in the second wave in South Africa (Tegally et al., 2021). Beta is also a variant of concern and a highly transmissible SARS CoV-2 variant (Yadav et al. 2021)..

Two other variants of interest such as A.23.1 and B.1.214 were also identified in this study. These variants were responsible for most of outbreaks in neighboring countries such as the Republic of Rwanda (Butera et al., 2021) and Uganda (Bugembe et al., 2021) emphasizing the role of neighboring countries in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Several Delta variant infection cases were from travelers crossing the Ruzizi border the main point of entry in South Kivu. These findings suggest multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 strains into South Kivu, eastern DRC mainly through international travelers and therefore require critical surveillance in the disease management strategies..

An increased frequency of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been reported throughout the pandemic with more than 3000 unique point mutations discovered across the world (Flores-Alanis et al., 2021). The current study showed that in the South Kivu population, Open reading Frame (ORF1ab) polyprotein, spike glycoprotein (S), nucleocapsin phosphoprotein (N), ORF3a, ORF7a, membrane glycoprotein (M), and envelop protein (E) were the mutation targets. The frequent mutations in these regions may be contributing to the adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 in human host and may lead to observed variations in pathogenicity of the virus. This agrees with a previous study reporting recurrent mutations in the same SARS-CoV-2 genome targets in the African population (Omotoso et al., 2021). Additionally, a similar study has shown that most of mutations are found within the ORF1ab, S and N genes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Wang et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020)..

Our study shows a higher number of missense mutations than synonymous mutations and half of them were located in the ORF1ab gene followed by the spike gene (49 missense mutations). A similar observation was reported in studies conducted in Colombia and Egypt (Bermúdez et al., 2021; Erdem et al., 2021; Zekri et al., 2021; Maitra et al., 2020). Interestingly, the L4715L mutation found in 60 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from this study corroborates with previous findings reporting the P4715L mutation as a potential antiviral drug target (Pachetti et al., 2020)..

Mutation analysis further showed many number of samples with D614G mutation in the spike glycoprotein (1841A>G) flagging this position as a SARS-CoV-2 mutation hotspot. A previous study has reported the same mutation in high number of sequences in Turkey and it has gradually become dominant in the world (Erdem et al. 2021). Additionally, the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been associated with increases infectivity and transmissibility (Lizhou et al., 2020)..

N gene encoding the nucleocapsid protein plays an important role in RNA packaging and the release of viral particles (Zeng et al., 2020). The most frequent mutation in this gene reported globally is the R203K, but it was shown not to affect the protein function. However, the R203K mutation was not found in our study; instead, we identified the R203M (608G>T) mutation whose functional impact is still unknown..

Several insertions/deletion mutations were in some of the sequences in this study even though further confirmation is required. However, these mutations would imply modification of the gene (protein) of concern and, therefore may affect the adaptability and or pathogenicity of the virus. Other point mutations that have not been reported before were also identified in many sequences. We can speculate a correlation between these genetic changes and virus adaptation because these mutations are never fixed in the population..

Conclusion.

This study analyzed SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes from 74 Congolese samples during the first, second and third waves. Two lineages including Delta (B.1.617.2) and Beta (B.1.351) were identified to be circulating with several mutations in coding genes. Delta was the most abundant of these lineages, especially during the third wave, causing most of the COVID-19 deaths in South Kivu from May to end July 2021. We cannot assume the possibility that the simultaneous circulation of these two SARS-CoV-2 variants could have exacerbated the transmissibility potential of the virus and thus caused devastating infections in this densely populated region. Our results further highlight a need for regional collaborations for a durable response towards combating COVID-19..
