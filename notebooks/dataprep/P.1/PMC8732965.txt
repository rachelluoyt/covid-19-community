The rapid spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants has highlighted the crucial role played in the infection by mutations occurring at the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) in the interactions with the human ACE2 receptor. In this context, it urgently needs to develop new rapid tools for quickly predicting the affinity of ACE2 for the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein variants to be used with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing activities in the clinics, aiming to gain clues about the transmissibility and virulence of new variants, to prevent new outbreaks and to quickly estimate the severity of the disease in the context of the 3PM..

In our study, we used a computational pipeline for calculating the interaction energies at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface for a selected group of characterized infectious variants of concern/interest (VoC/VoI). By using our pipeline, we built 3D comparative models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein complexes for the VoC B.1.1.7-United Kingdom (carrying the mutations of concern/interest N501Y, S494P, E484K at the RBD), P.1-Japan/Brazil (RBD mutations: K417T, E484K, N501Y), B.1.351-South Africa (RBD mutations: K417N, E484K, N501Y), B.1.427/B.1.429-California (RBD mutations: L452R), the B.1.141 (RBD mutations: N439K), and the recent B.1.617.1-India (RBD mutations: L452R; E484Q) and the B.1.620 (RBD mutations: S477N; E484K). Then, we used the obtained 3D comparative models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein complexes for predicting the interaction energies at the protein–protein interface..

Along SARS-CoV-2 mutation database screening and mutation localization analysis, it was ascertained that the most dangerous mutations at VoC/VoI spike proteins are located mainly at three regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike “boat-shaped” receptor binding motif, on the RBD domain. Notably, the P.1 Japan/Brazil variant present three mutations, K417T, E484K, N501Y, located along the entire receptor binding motif, which apparently determines the highest interaction energy at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface, among those calculated. Conversely, it was also observed that the replacement of a single acidic/hydrophilic residue with a basic residue (E484K or N439K) at the “stern” or “bow” regions, of the boat-shaped receptor binding motif on the RBD, appears to determine an interaction energy with ACE2 receptor higher than that observed with single mutations occurring at the “hull” region or with other multiple mutants. In addition, our pipeline allowed searching for ACE2 structurally related proteins, i.e., THOP1 and NLN, which deserve to be investigated for their possible involvement in interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in those tissues showing a low expression of ACE2, or as a novel receptor for future spike variants. A freely available web-tool for the in silico calculation of the interaction energy at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface, starting from the sequences of the investigated spike and/or ACE2 variants, was made available for the scientific community at: https://www.mitoairm.it/covid19affinities..

In the context of the PPPM/3PM, the employment of the described pipeline through the provided webservice, together with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing, would help to predict the transmissibility of new variants sequenced from future patients, depending on SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing activities and on the specific amino acid replacement and/or on its location on the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, to put in play all the possible counteractions for preventing the most deleterious scenarios of new outbreaks, taking into consideration that a greater transmissibility has not to be necessarily related to a more severe manifestation of the disease..

A coronavirus identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory disease called COVID-19 [1–3]. WHO reports that there have been 244,385,444 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 4,961,489 deaths (27 October 2021, https://covid19.who.int/) due to the spread of several SARS-CoV-2 variants [1, 4–6]. Although the mechanism of infection was deeply investigated taking to the observation that a direct interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor is responsible for the host-cell virus entry [7–11], a definitive cure for COVID-19 is not available yet [12–16]. Nevertheless, the employment of several approved vaccines [17–20] is helping in preventing the worst scenario for the current outbreak by limiting the most severe effects of the disease in vaccinated people and by reducing virus circulation [21]. Also, the intense SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing activity in clinics is helping in the early recognition of new variants that deserve to be studied for evaluating their improved ability in penetrating host-cells and/or in escaping vaccine induced antibodies [22–25]..

Along genome sequencing analysis it was observed that variants of concern/interest (VoC/VoI) showing mutations at the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) are those that need to be monitored more carefully due to their involvement in direct interactions with the human dipeptidyl carboxydipeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor, causing the host-cell invasion [7–9]..

SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing activities are crucial for the early detection of new variants and several databases provide clues about VoC and VoI mutations, although it happens that the same mutations can be detected in different variants [4, 26]. Sometimes nomenclature problems and mutation detection in different strains just depend on the mutation prevalence in the lineage, other times it depends on technical annotation problems [4, 26]. Although the effort for sequencing activities and database sequence collection was enormous, it still lacks a quantifiable parameter to be monitored, maybe through an automated in silico tool, for quickly predicting the transmissibility (how easy viruses spread [27]) and virulence (how harmful is a virus for its host [28]) of new variants..

Indeed, at the moment only the direct observation and quantification of a SARS-CoV-2 variant spread [29] together with relatively “slow/controversial” in vitro binding assays [30] provide clues about the transmissibility [27] or virulence/pathogenicity [28] of new variants, when the virus is already circulating. Some computational tools are used to calculate the stability and/or preliminary immunogenic properties of SARS-CoV-2 mutated proteins [31, 32], but those tools are further time-consuming and cannot be easily adapted in the short-term period for dealing with the current pandemic in the context of the 3PM approaches..

Thus, it might be crucial to identify a parameter to be quickly computationally calculated/quantified, which may correlate with the transmissibility [27] or the virulence [28] of a variant. It should be mentioned that a greater virulence is related to a greater ability of the virus to replicate in the host organism often causing a more severe disease, although resulting usually in a lower transmissibility [33]. Conversely, a lower virulence is often correlated with a higher transmissibility [27], as already observed for recent variants showing new mutations, i.e., D614G, at the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (relatively far from the RBD region involved in direct interactions with the ACE2 receptor), which resulted in a less deadly virus. As a consequence of the lower lethality, the spike D614G mutation is currently detectable in most of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (https://covdb.stanford.edu/page/mutation-viewer; [34–36])..

There is also the need to clarify the role of ACE2 variants, existing in the world population (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/gene/ENSG00000130234?dataset=exac), in variability and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection [37–39]. In order to gain new insights about ACE2 role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, it would be useful to sequence directly ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 genes from hospitalized patients. Indeed, it is well established that protein–protein interactions depend both on residues at the protein–protein interface but also on residues far from the protein–protein interface that can participate to protein folding through long-range interactions [40–44]. Similarly, it is expected that the combination SARS-CoV-2 spike variants interacting with ACE2 variants will produce different interaction energies that may reflect a different susceptibility to COVID-19 [37–39], despite of the average transmissibility and virulence of a strain estimated without taking into account the personal patient genetic context..

More in general, we expect that the calculation of the interaction energies between a specific SARS-CoV-2 spike variant and a specific ACE2 variant, as sequenced from the affected patients, may provide a more robust prediction about the specific SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 interaction energies in a patient or in an asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic carrier..

A modular molecular framework for predicting in silico the binding affinity of ACE2 variants for SARS-CoV-2 spike VoC to get preliminary indications about new variant transmissibility and virulence in the context of the 3PM approaches..

In light of what was reported about the role of SARS-CoV-2 spike variants and ACE2 variants, we keep in mind that it would be useful to consider the SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 interaction energy as a quantifiable parameter for predicting SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 binding affinity, which might show a positive correlation with virus virulence (i.e., the ability of the virus to enter host-cells and consequently replicate itself, resulting in more harmful or even deadly consequences [28]) and a negative correlation with virus transmissibility (i.e., the ability of the virus to spread in the population causing a less severe disease [27, 33]). The calculation of the interaction energy at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface, would help to get a preliminary indication about the possible increased/decreased virulence of a new strain. Indeed, we would expect that an increased SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 binding affinity might reflect an increased ability of the virus to replicate within the host organism with more severe outcomes, whereas a decreased binding affinity may result in a less lethal but more transmissible virus [27, 33], as already observed in the correlation between protein–protein binding affinity along pathogen–host interactions and pathogen virulence in other biological systems [45–47]..

With this aim, we develop a computational pipeline to calculate the interaction energies at the SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 protein–protein interface, starting from the SARS-CoV-2 spike and ACE2 amino acid sequences, as sequenced from patients, to predict the binding affinity of the spike protein of new variants for a specific human ACE2 variant..

The computational pipeline here presented consists of a modular molecular framework that was initially used for investigating SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD)/ACE2 interactions and the spike pre/post-fusion conformational changes [7]..

Now, it was modified to quickly predict binding affinities of the human ACE2 receptor for the spike protein RBD of infectious VoC/VoI, as long as SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing activities quickly indicate the existence of new variants. Indeed, by using our pipeline and starting from sequencing data, it is possible to build a reliable 3D model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in complex with ACE2 for the following calculation of the interaction energy at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface and for the estimation of their binding affinity, to be compared with the interaction energies calculated between the hCoV.19Wuhan.WIV04.2019 spike sequence and/or other characterized spike variants (i.e., those proposed in this manuscript) and the reference ACE2 protein [7]..

Thus, aiming to test our pipeline and to investigate the effect of amino acid replacement at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, as observed within the most studied VoC, we built a 3D comparative model for each spike variant showing an amino acid replacement at the RBD positions K417; N439; L452, E484; S477; S494; N501, as highlighted in the SARS-CoV-2 VoC B.1.1.7-United Kingdom (UK, mutations of concern/interest at the RBD: N501Y, S494P, E484K), P.1-Japan/Brazil (K417T, E484K, N501Y), B.1.351-South Africa (S. Africa, mutations of concern/interest: K417N, E484K, N501Y), B.1.427/B.1.429-California (mutations of concern/interest: L452R), the B.1.141 variant (mutations of concern/interest: N439K), the recent B.1.617.1-India (mutations of concern/interest: L452R; E484Q), and the B.1.620 (mutations of concern/interest: namely S477N; E484K). Notably, all the cited VoC genomes have been sequenced in the last year and are responsible for the evolution of current pandemics situation [6, 25, 48–52]..

Knowing the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 protein complexes in case of detection of new SARS-CoV-2 spike variants might be crucial to gain clues about transmissibility and virulence of the new detected variant. Indeed, it is recognized that a greater spike/ACE2 affinity may result in a more rapid spread of the investigated variant and in the loss of efficiency of vaccines based on a specific spike elder sequence, i.e., the YP_009724390.1 sequence and the related coding DNA sequence (CDS), namely the hCoV.19Wuhan.WIV04.2019 sequence, https://www.gisaid.org/hcov19-variants/) [19, 20]..

On the other hand, a similar approach can be trained by coupling the predicted binding affinity values with the number of infected people and with data about disease severity (from the known variants and/or from current and future hospitalized patients) and the trained algorithm can be used to model the interaction between next SARS-CoV-2 spike variants and ACE2 variants to predict their binding affinities for improving transmissibility, virulence and disease severity prediction, for the early recognition of the most dangerous variants..

This knowledge might help to early alert the scientific community to think about new rounds of vaccination by using new vaccines based on a cocktail of the newly identified (or predicted as dangerous) spike sequences (in the form of mRNA [19, 20] or proteins/subdomains [53–55]) showing high affinities for the human host-cell receptors and/or to design new targeted antibodies [7, 56] for preventing new outbreaks due to the more virulent variants..

Finally, given the low expression of ACE2 observed in some tissues highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and the acquired knowledge about a set of possible human host-cell entry factors [57–60], we used our computational pipeline for predicting ACE2 structurally related receptors, aiming to identify other putative SARS-CoV-2 entry sites in human host cells, based on a folding recognition approach, more than on sequence/functional comparative analysis..

Starting from the atomic coordinates of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein domain extracted from 6m0j.pdb (according to the YP_009724390.1 sequence), we built the 3D comparative models of the investigated RBD mutants with specific reference to the single mutants N501Y, E484K/Q, N439K, K417N/T, L452R, S477N, and S494P; the double mutants L452R-E484Q and S477N-E484K; and the triple mutants N501Y-E484K-K417N, N501Y-E484K-S494P, and N501Y-E484K-K417T by using the mutagenesis tool implemented in SwissPDBViewer [61]..

In order to obtain a pose of the 3D protein complex of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD mutants interacting with ACE2, the built 3D comparative models of the mutants were superimposed to the 3D protein complex consisting of the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD interacting with ACE2, available under the 6m0j.pdb protein data bank (PDB) entry..

All the generated 3D all-atom models were energetically minimized using the Yasara Minimization server and residues packing was checked and repaired, where necessary, according to the FOLDX repair function [62]. PyMol [63] (https://www.pymol.org) was then used for examining (by manual inspection) the obtained 3D structure models, and for checking the correct packing of local secondary structures..

The variation in the number of interactions (hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), ionic and aromatic interactions) at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 interface in presence of the investigated amino acid replacements have been calculated by using the PIC webserver [64] and verified by manual inspection by using PyMOL..

ACE2 structural related proteins were sampled by using the folding recognition methods implemented in pGenThreader [65] and I-Tasser [66]. With this aim, the amino acid sequence of ACE2 (NP_001358344.1) was used as query sequence for running pGenThreader (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) and I-Tasser (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) to screen the PDB, searching for ACE2 structurally related crystallized proteins [7, 65–71]..

The crystallized structures of the proteins sampled by pGenThreader and I-Tasser analysis were structurally aligned with the 3D coordinates of ACE2 available under the PDB_ID 6m0j.pdb. For obtaining the structural alignment, we used the “super” command available in Pymol [63], which is able to structurally align also proteins with a lower percentage of identical residues, due to its ability in providing a sequence-independent structure-based pairwise alignment [7, 67, 69, 70]..

The sequences of the investigated crystallized ACE2 structurally related proteins were aligned using ClustaW [72] and optimized by visual inspection based on the structural alignment obtained by PyMOL [63]..

In order to obtain the most likely 3D protein complexes of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD interacting with the highlighted ACE2 structurally related receptors “dipeptidyl carboxydipeptidase angiotensin I converting enzyme 1 (ACE, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1636),” “thymet oligopeptidase 1 (THOP1, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7064),” and “neurolysin peptidase (NLN, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/57486),” the sampled crystallized structures of ACE, THOP1 and NLN were superimposed on the structure of the human ACE2 receptor within 6m0j.pdb, crystallized in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD..

The obtained 3D coordinates of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (according to the YP_009724390.1 sequence as obtained from 6m0j.pdb) in complex with ACE, THOP1, and NLN were each saved in a new PDB file..

The variation in the number of interactions (hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), ionic and aromatic interactions) at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 structurally related proteins (i.e., RBD/ACE; RBD/THOP1; RBD/NLN) interface have been calculated by using the PIC webserver [64] and verified by manual inspection by using PyMOL..

The 3D coordinates of the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD crystallized in complex with the human ACE2 receptor available under the PDB_ID 6m0j.pdb were used to estimate the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD for the human ACE2 (i.e., from the reference sequence NP_001358344.1) by using the FoldX AnalyseComplex assay [73]. The calculated binding affinity of the two protein domains within the crystallized 6m0j.pdb was used as a reference value for the following comparative analyses [7]..

Indeed, the FoldX AnalyseComplex assay was performed to determine the interaction energy between the investigated minimized protein complexes consisting of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD mutants (N501Y, E484K/Q, N439K, K417N/T, L452R, S477N, S494P, the double mutants L452R-E484Q, S477N-E484K, and the triple mutants N501Y-E484K-K417N, N501Y-E484K-S494P, and N501Y-E484K-K417T) and ACE2..

Furthermore, the FoldX AnalyseComplex assay was used for determining the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and the ACE2 structurally related receptors ACE, THOP1, and NLN, identified through pGenTHREADER and/or I-TASSER analyses..

The way the FoldX AnalyseComplex operates is by unfolding the selected targets and determining the stability of the remaining molecules and then subtracting the sum of the individual energies from global energy [7]. More negative energy values indicate a better binding, whereas positive energy values indicate no binding [73, 74]..

The GTEx portal (https://gtexportal.org/home/, [75]) was screened to assess the gene expression levels of ACE2 structurally related receptors, i.e., ACE, THOP1, and NLN, and of many other genes proposed to play a crucial role in host-cell virus entry processes, i.e., the immunoglobulin basigin (BSG, also known as CD147, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/682), the interferon-induced membrane protein IFITM3 (known for being involved in the protection against several viruses, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10410), the FURIN protease (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5045), the lysosomal cysteine peptidases CTSB (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1508) and CTSL (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1514), the membrane alanyl aminopeptidase ANPEP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/290), the transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7113) and TMPRSS4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/56649), the dipeptidyl peptidase DPP4 (also known as CD26, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1803), the glycan-binding receptors of the C-type lectin family (known for being involved in the recognition of several viruses and bacteria) CLEC4G (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/339390) and CLEC4M (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10332), and the lymphocyte antigen 6E LY6E (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4061) [59, 60]..

The analysis about SARS-CoV-2 VoC spread in the last year has highlighted the important role played by amino acid replacements occurring at the spike RBD in SARS-CoV-2 host-cell entry and virus infection [7–9, 11, 18, 22–25, 76]. Here, we report about the employment of a computational pipeline for the estimation of binding affinity and interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD variants and ACE2 in presence of mutations occurring at seven positions of the spike RBD, as observed in seven VoC (Fig. 1), chosen among the best characterized variants (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/variants-concern).Fig. 1Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD amino acid sequences highlighted from the reported sequenced VoC.

Notably, the RBM highlighted on the head of the spike RBD is the main RBD portion involved in direct binding interactions with ACE2, mainly consisting of H-bonds and/or ionic and aromatic interactions.Fig. 23D comparative models of the investigated RBD mutants.

More in detail, the investigated L452R and E484Q amino acid replacements cause a local re-arrangement that perturbs the small beta-sheet in the “hull” region of the boat-shaped RBM (residues 450–455, Fig. 2), whereas N501Y, K417N, E484K and N439K amino acid replacements cause a conformational change in an alpha-helix close to N501 and N439 in the “stern” region (residues 436–449 and 497–503). Although S494P, approximately located in the center of the “boat-hull” region (residues 491–496), and S477N, located on the tip of the “boat-bow” region (residues 468–490) do not produce a viewable local conformational change, it is well known that the replacement of a serine may confer a different flexibility to the local secondary structure elements hosting the investigated mutation, due to the different abilities of Ser/Pro/Asn/Thr residues in producing kink/hinge movements [77, 78]..

The perturbation of the local secondary structure of structural elements hosting the cited amino acid replacements also triggers the formation of new H-bonds, ionic and aromatic interactions and local conformational changes at the protein–protein interface along interactions with ACE2 (Figs. 3 and 4, Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).Fig. 3SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD–ACE2 protein–protein binding interactions in presence of the investigated amino acid replacements.

The pie charts are realized with R (version 4.0.5) by means of ggplot2 library. For each pie chart, labels are used for indicating the investigated VoC and the number of interactions detected at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface for each interaction type/color reported in the legend. The corresponding percentage of a specific interaction type among the total counted interactions is reported between brackets. It is possible to see that H-bonds are the most represented interactions. Variations in the size of the different pie-chart portions reflect a change in the detected interactions at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface as a consequence of the indicated mutations. By comparing the reported number of interactions with the calculated binding energies (Table 1), it might be speculated that mutations causing a decrease in the “protein–protein side chain-side chain H-bonds” and simultaneously an increase in the “protein–protein main chain–side chain” H-bonds can be responsible for an increase in the interaction energy at the SARS-CoV-2 spike/RBD protein–protein interface, as a consequence of a greater direct involvement of both protein-backbones in protein–protein interactionsTable 1FoldX interection energies between the ACE2 human receptor and the investigated RBD amino acid replacements. Please, note that more negative “interaction energy” values, reported here in kcal/mol, indicate stronger interaction energies and thus higher binding affinity at the indicated SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface [7, 73]. The energy terms and contributions are reported in kcal/mol according to FOLDX indications. Each energy term has a specific weight in the calculation of the interaction energy, according to the equations reported in [73].

Indeed, it is possible to count a slight increase in the hydrophobic interactions within a range of 5 Å at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 interface in the B.1.1.7-UK (S494P_N501Y_E484K); in the P.1 Japan/Brazil (N501Y_E484K_K417T) or in the B.1.351 S. Africa (N501Y_E484K_K417N) VoC (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 4)..

Some variations are observed in the number of protein–protein main chain–side chain hydrogen bonds which are apparently decreased at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 interface in the B.1.1.7-UK (S494P_N501Y_E484K), in the B.1.617.1-India (E484Q_L452), in the B.1.427/B.1.429 California (L452R), and in the B.1.617. Indian (E484Q_L452R) VoC, whereas the same interactions appear increased in number in the P.1 Japan/Brazil (N501Y_E484K_K417T) and in the B.1.141 VoC N439K (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 4)..

A larger number of variations are observed in the number of protein–protein side chain–side chain hydrogen bonds. Indeed, side chain–side chain H-bonds decrease at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 interface in all the VoC with the exception of the B.1.427/B.1.429 California L452R VoC (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 4)..

New protein–protein aromatic–aromatic interactions (within 4.5 and 7 Å) and protein–protein cation-π interactions are observed at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 interface in all the VoCs showing the N501Y amino acid replacement (with specific reference to B.1.1.7-UK (S494P_N501Y_E484K), P.1 Japan/Brazil (N501Y_E484K_K417T) and B.1.351 S. Africa (N501Y_E484K_K417N) showing new aromatic interactions with the ACE2 Tyr41 and cation-π interactions with the ACE2 Lys353 (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 4). The number of protein–protein ionic interactions (within 6 Å) at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 interface may increase depending on the investigated amino acid replacement and its steric hinderance. That is, L452R is the mutant with the greater number of protein–protein ionic interactions (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 4)..

From an energetical point of view, the P.1 Japan/Brazil VoC, showing the three mutations N501Y_E484K_K417T at the RBD, has the highest binding affinity (− 21.37 kcal/mol or − 89.41 kJ/mol; Table 1) for ACE2 (increased of 4% with respect to the Wuhan spike RBD, − 20.51 kcal/mol or − 85.81 kJ/mol, Table 1), followed by the B.1.141-VoC showing the single N439K amino acid replacement at the RBD and the single mutant E484K firstly detected in the spike RBD of the P.1 Japan/Brazil VoC (Table 1). All the other single and multiple amino acid replacements show a slightly decreased interaction energy with ACE2 (Table 1), at variance with what observed for the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 interactions..

With the exception of the B.1.427/B.1.429 California VoC (L452R) and B.1.141 (N439K) showing one more interaction (39 interactions) with respect to the interactions detected at the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface (38 residues), all the other investigated ACE2/RBD complexes showed a decrease in the number of detected interactions at the protein–protein interface caused by the investigated amino acid replacements. The B.1.1.7-UK (S494P_N501Y_E484K) variant and the B.1.617-India (E484Q_L452R) VoC show the lowest number of interactions (27 and 29, respectively) at the RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface, according to PIC estimations (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1)..

In order to allow clinicians and researchers to predict the binding affinity of new SARS-CoV-2 spike variants for ACE2 variants through our modular molecular framework and pipeline, in the context of the 3PM approaches, a webservice has been made available from our laboratory at the following link https://www.mitoairm.it/covid19affinities. Clinicians and researchers can directly upload through the provided link both the sequenced spike RBD and ACE2 amino acid sequences for calculating the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 interaction energies to be compared with interaction energies obtained at the protein–protein interface within the crystallized protein complex (6m0j.pdb) consisting of the hCoV.19Wuhan.WIV04.2019 RBD (YP_009724390.1) and the ACE2 reference protein (NP_001358344.1) and/or the other interaction energies data available from this manuscript, for estimating a possible higher transmissibility or virulence of future detected variants, depending on an increased predicted SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 binding affinity..

ACE2 sequence was used for screening the PDB, searching for ACE2 structurally related proteins that might work as host-cell entry sites for SARS-CoV-2. The performed screening revealed the presence of several crystallized structures of ACE2 and of the structural/functional related ACE protein from several mammalia and insecta species (Table 2). Furthermore, the screening revealed the presence of several oligopeptidases from bacteria and protista, structurally related to ACE2 in the PDB (Supplementary Table 2). Notably, two mammalia oligopeptidases, THOP1 and NLN, were highlighted as ACE2 structurally related proteins (Table 2). ACE2 [79] shares with ACE [80], THOP1 [81], and NLN [82] the 34% (49%), 18% (33%), and 17% (35%) of identical (similar) residues.Table 2Extract of ACE2 structurally/functionally related proteins sampled by pGenThreader/I-TASSER (see also Supplementary Table 2 for a complete list of the sampled structures).

Notably, the smaller the RMSD is between two structures, the more similar are the two compared structures [83].

The four proteins share a very similar overall structure (Fig. 5). Indeed, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the atomic coordinates of the available THOP1 and NLN crystallized structures and the investigated ACE2 structure ranges between 3.9 and 4.5 Å (Table 2, Fig. 5).Fig. 5Superimposition of the ACE2 structurally related proteins ACE, THOP1, and NLN to ACE2. The superimposition of the three ACE2 structurally related proteins to ACE2 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD allows to highlight the overall structural similarity between ACE, ACE2, NLN, and THOP1 and based on the observed structural similarity it is possible to speculate about a possible interaction between the three ACE2 structurally related proteins and the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, that might be favored by future spike variants showing mutations at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. A–D four inspections of the lateral view rotated of 90° (along the RBD z axis) within each column showing the superimposition of ACE (6h5w.pdb, magenta cartoon) on ACE2 ((6m0j.pdb, yellow cartoon) interacting with the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (6m0j.pdb, light grey cartoon).

At the protein–protein interface, it is possible to see that ACE shows two alpha-helices, similarly oriented to the two alpha-helices that represent in ACE2 the main surface of interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. THOP1 and NLN show the same alpha-helices in close contact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and an extra helix parallel to the previous two, forming other interactions with the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Comparative structural analysis of the ACE2 structurally related proteins ACE, THOP1, and NLN. The superimposition of the three ACE2 structurally related proteins to ACE2 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD has also allowed to highlight the putative secondary structure elements and specific residues involved in possible interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and the three ACE2 structurally related proteins, ACE, NLN and THOP1.

I–L Zoomed views of the RBD (light grey cartoon) showing the RBD amino acids K417; N439; L452; E484; S494; N501 (magenta sticks) observed mutated in the investigated VoC. I Residues within 4 Å from SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD highlighted within ACE2 (yellow), K ACE (magenta), J THOP1 (green), and L NLN (cyan) are reported in colored sticks. ACE2 structurally related receptor residues within 4 Å from the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein positions observed mutated in the investigated VoC are reported in blue sticks (see Supplementary Table 1 for a list of the detected interactions between the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and ACE2 structurally related receptors according to PIC estimations).

Although the investigated proteins share a low percentage of identical residues, local secondary structures crucial for interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, consisting of the investigated receptor residues located within 4 Å from the RBD are very similar (Fig. 7). The ACE protein region in contact with the RBD is the most similar to the corresponding counterpart in ACE2 (Fig. 7). The four proteins share one longer helix similarly oriented (residues L29-Q50, ACE2 sequence numbering; and residues L65-Q86, THOP1 sequence numbering) and one superimposable beta-sheet different in length (residues T347-L359, ACE2 sequence numbering, and residues A426-L459, THOP1 sequence numbering). THOP1 and NLN show an extra helix consisting of their N-terminal region (residues L24-T64, THOP1 sequence numbering) and show a beta-sheet in place of the helix located close to the “stern” portion of the boat-shaped RBD head (residues T324-L333, ACE2 sequence numbering, and residues E406-L415, THOP1 sequence numbering). A last region with a relative different orientation in the space consists of the THOP1 bent helix (residues M112-K128, THOP1 sequence numbering) corresponding to the ACE2 bent helix (residues L73-Q89, ACE2 sequence numbering) (Fig. 7).Fig. 7A, B Zoomed views of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD head (white cartoon) in contact with the ACE2 structurally related proteins.

While ACE shows an interaction energy with RBD lower than the ones observed in presence of ACE2, the calculated interaction energies between the SARS-CoV-spike RBD and THOP1 or NLN appear to be stronger than those calculated for ACE2 (Table 3).Table 3FoldX interection energies between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 structurally related proteins.

GTEx database was screened for estimating the expression levels of ACE2, ACE, THOP1, and NLN together with other SARS-CoV-2 host-cell entry factors in all the tissues available on GTEx. From this analysis, THOP1 resulted more expressed than ACE2 in all the screened tissues (with the exception of kidney cortex, heart left ventricle, adipose visceral, small intestine, showing THOP1/ACE2 similar expression levels) and, most importantly, it is highly expressed in the lung, in the colon, in the esophagus mucosa and in all the brain compartments, in which ACE2 appears poorly expressed (Fig. 8). The expression of NLN or ACE is comparable to, or slightly higher than, ACE2 expression in all the investigated tissues with the exception of heart, adipose tissue, intestine, and testis.Fig. 8Expression of SARS-CoV-2 host-cell entry factors.

The rapid spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants [1, 6, 48] makes it necessary to develop new tools for evaluating the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins for the host cell receptors. A crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is played by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, whose interactions with ACE2 receptor triggers pre-/post-fusion conformational changes causing the virus entry into the human cells [7, 55]. The spike domain responsible for direct interactions with the human ACE2 receptor is the RBD [7, 9, 11, 84–86]. Thus, great attention is dedicated to mutations occurring at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, because they can cause an increase in the binding affinity of the spike protein for the human ACE2 receptor, which may reflect an increased transmissibility or a new acquired antibody escape ability [7, 22–25, 87]..

Previously [7], we have determined the interaction energies between the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and the human ACE2 receptor available under the PDB_ID 6vw1.pdb [7, 10]. However, the crystallized structure of 6vw1.pdb consisted of a chimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD interacting with ACE2 [10]. The chimeric RBD from 6vw1.pdb showed 22 missense mutations and the deletion of three residues at the RBD with respect to the amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD according to the Wuhan reference sequence available under the refseq accession number YP_009724390.1. Less than one year ago, the coordinates of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (according to YP_009724390.1) crystallized in complex with the human ACE2 receptor were made available under the PDB_ID 6mo0j.pdb [88]. Thus, we used the 3D coordinates of 6m0j.pdb for re-estimating the interaction energies at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface and we modelled RBD mutants on the 6m0j.pdb protein template and quantified the affinity of the known RBD mutants for the human ACE2 receptor. More in detail we studied the impact of the mutations responsible for the investigated VoC B.1.1.7-UK (carrying the mutations of concern/interest N501Y, S494P, E484K), P.1-Japan/Brazil (K417N/T, E484K, N501Y), B.1.351-S. Africa (K417N, E484K, N501Y), B.1.427/B.1.429-California (L452R), the B.1.141 (N439K) and the recent B.1. 617-India (L452R, E484Q) VoC. The effect of the investigated mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD structure and on RBD/ACE2 interactions was checked revealing that all of them might perturb the RBD structure either at the level of the secondary structure elements hosting the investigated mutations or at the level of spatially close secondary structure elements on the entire RBD head..

Through the monitoring of the binding interactions, it is possible to see that H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions among side chains at the protein–protein interface, but also backbone–side chain H-bonds, among the very short-range (< 3.8 Å) interactions [42], can substantially increase or decrease as a consequence of a mutation occurring at the boat-shaped RBM of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, as observed for the single N439K amino acid replacement occurring at the “stern” RBM region, or for the B.1.141 VoC or in the P.1 Japan/Brazil VoC consisting of the triple mutant N501Y_E484K_K417T showing mutations along the entire RBM, with respect to the interactions calculated in the crystallized SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein complex (6m0j.pdb) used as a reference structure. The replacement of N501 with a tyrosine introduces new aromatic-aromatic and π-aromatic binding interactions in the short/medium-range (3.8–9.5 Å) interactions [42], without apparently increasing SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 binding affinity..

By monitoring binding affinity and interaction energies, it appears that the single amino acid replacements N439K (B.1.141 VoC) and E484K (detected in several VoC) cause the most dramatic increase in interaction energies among the investigated single mutants. In addition, the triple mutant N501Y_E484K_K417T detected in the P.1 Japan/Brazil VoC [24, 52] shows an increase of about 5% in binding affinity that might reflect the greater ability shown by this VoC in escaping antibodies produced as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-sequence based vaccination [24]. Also, the B.1.1.7_UK S494P_N501Y_E484K investigated variant shows an important variation in the interactions at the ACE2/RBD interface and a decrease in the calculated interaction energies. Notably, this VoC shows the replacement of S494 with a proline residue. P, S, and G play a hinge role in local secondary structures especially when other P, S or G are near in the sequence [78, 89]. The replacement of a serine with a proline may confer less flexibility to the local secondary structure and thus it is retained this mutation limits RBD local flexibility causing a decrease in the number of short/medium-range interactions [42] at the ACE2/RBD interface. It can be argued that the limited flexibility introduced by the S494P amino acid replacement decreases the affinity for ACE2 and makes sensitive this VoC to antibodies produced by vaccination [52], despite of the presence of N501Y and E484K that as single mutants show a higher affinity for the ACE2 receptor. A similar reduced flexibility might be expected for the RBD of the double mutant S477N_E484K due to the replacement of the Ser 477 with an Asn residue. Our conclusions about changes in interaction energies and number of interactions for the investigated VoC are coherent with the expected effects about spike RBD/ACE2 interactions and antibody escape reported for the described VoC [22–25, 49–52]. In order to better link binding affinity, transmissibility, virulence and disease severity, it would be useful to associate the calculated SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 interaction energies with both the number of infected people with a specific variant and the disease severity (when possible)..

While several studies about in vitro ACE2/spike binding assays are becoming available, an in vitro golden standard technique for quickly estimating the interaction energies between ACE2 and RBD variants is difficult to establish due to relative differences observed between the binding affinity estimated for the ACE2/Wuhan spike protein–protein complex and those estimated for ACE2/RBD variants ([90–92] and Supplementary Table 3). The observed differences can be ascribed to the employment of the only RBD instead of the entire spike protein, as well as to the employment of living cells expressing ACE2 (full length) or recombinant truncated human ACE2 ectodomain. Also, the different employed ACE2/RBD ratio in the performed binding assays, as well as the different probes and employed detectors can be related to the observed differences in binding affinity (Supplementary Table 3)..

Among the investigated VoC-RBDs, the triple RBD mutant of the P.1 Japan/Brazil VoC shows the highest increase in the binding affinity (a 5% increase) compared to the binding affinity estimated for the Wuhan spike RBD/ACE2 protein complex. All the other mutants show lower increases or decreases in the calculated interaction energies, compared to the Wuhan spike RBD/ACE2 protein complex. These considerations make us hypothesize that an increase of less than 5% in the calculated interaction energies between the VoC-RBDs and ACE2, compared to interactions energies calculated for the Wuhan spike RBD/ACE2 protein complex, will not dramatically change the virulence of new SARS-CoV-2 VoC, making them still sensitive to the current employed Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 based vaccines [29, 93], although a slightly increased VoC-RBD/ACE2 binding affinity might determine a lower affinity for the vaccine induced antibodies [22–24]. Conversely, VoC showing acidic/hydrophilic amino acid replacement with basic residues at the “stern” and “bow” regions of the boat-shaped RBM on the spike RBD, or more than 3 simultaneous mutations along the entire RBM on the spike RBD head, and/or an increase of more than 5–10% in the calculated interaction energies with ACE2 should deserve great attention..

In this context interaction energies quickly calculated by using the described molecular framework can be used for leading/driving in vitro binding assays, as a more replicable in vitro binding assay will be established, for estimating the putative aggressiveness of new VoC, and for the development of new vaccines and antibodies..

Furthermore, while trying to understand if there was an underestimation of SARS-CoV-2 preexisting immunity [94], in the context of personalized medicine, it should be stressed that our molecular framework can be used for investigating and explaining the resistance shown by some individuals to the infection or to the development of clinical manifestations despite infection, by evaluating the importance of single gene variants in the cell entry factors [59] shown by resistant individuals, starting from putative ACE2 variants [39, 95]. At the same time this kind of analysis might help in drawing new recombinant ACE2 proteins with very high affinity for spike RBD variants to be administered to patients for blocking or slowing down the infection [96]..

In the end, we wondered about the possible existence of ACE2 structurally related receptors that might interact with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in those tissues showing ACE2 poorly expressed [59, 60]. Our fold-recognition based analysis revealed that beyond the expected ACE, THOP1, and NLN appear structurally related to ACE2. ACE, THOP1, and NLN share the “oligopeptidase/receptor” activity with ACE2 and show at least one isoform localized at the plasma membrane [97, 98]. While ACE appears to form a weaker protein complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, in our interaction analyses, the interaction energies calculated at the protein–protein interface of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/THOP1 or SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/NLN show binding energies higher than those calculated for the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein complex, maybe due to a supplementary alpha-helix located at the interface with the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in the obtained 3D protein complexes. NLN and THOP1 participate to the cleavage of cytosolic peptides and share the 80% of identical residues [98]..

While the expression of NLN or ACE is comparable to or slightly higher than ACE2 expression in all the investigated tissues, it is possible to see that THOP1 is highly more expressed than ACE2 in most of the screened tissues and, most importantly, it is highly expressed in the lung, in the colon, in the esophagus mucosa and in all the brain compartments..

Although THOP1 and ACE2 show a low percentage of identical residues (< 30%), their related biochemical function and high structural similarity (overall RMSD < 4.5 Å) make THOP1 a suggestive/alternative candidate receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In addition, in our GTEx analyses the high expression of THOP1 appears to correlate with high expression levels of the Furin protease, which may participate to spike cleavage allowing pre-/post-fusion conformational changes crucial for host-cell penetration [59, 99], above all in those tissues showing a low ACE2 expression, i.e., in the lung, in the esophagus mucosa or in the brain. Notably, THOP1 expression was observed upregulated in COVID-19 infected patients and in particular in the effector CD8 T-cells of COVID-19 patients at the beginning of the infection [100]. Furthermore, THOP1 appears to play a crucial role in the regulation of MHC I cell-surface expression [101–103]. Due to the shown high expression of THOP1 in several brain compartments and in the effector CD8 T-cells of COVID-19 patients [100], it raises the question about a possible relationship between different SARS-CoV-2 immune responses [100, 104], neurological disorders observed in long covid patients, and THOP1 involvement in MHC-class I regulation in COVID-19 patients [105–107]..

While waiting for a definitive quick in vitro binding assay for estimating SARS-CoV-2 variant transmissibility, virulence, and disease severity, the presented approach may represent a valid tool for gaining clues about new virus strain aggressiveness. The presented strategy just consists of a computational pipeline with no consumable costs, needing only a good internet connection for using the webservice, as long as the hospital laboratory is able to provide genome sequencing data (in the context of personalized medicine). The employment of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in combination with a pipeline like the ones here presented would help in quickly highlighting new SARS-CoV-2 spike variants with high affinity for ACE2 to be carefully monitored and that is the reason for which similar pipelines should be routinely used in clinics in this pandemic era. Indeed, the early recognition of a SARS-CoV-2 spike variant with high affinity for the human ACE2 would alert clinicians, who would then be able to deal with patients in the safest way or to contact people positive to the test to provide appropriate support and indications, also in case of asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic people carrying dangerous variants. On this concern, it would also be useful to sequence ACE2 in all those patients/carriers of new SARS-CoV-2 spike variants, which would help in calculating the binding affinity at the SARS-CoV-2 spike variant/ACE2 variant protein–protein interface in a more detailed way, by using our molecular framework. This would also help in explaining a variation in binding affinity as well as in collecting data about a putative innate (partial or complete) immunity, depending on specific mutations also on ACE2 and/or on the severity of disease manifestations. The employment of our molecular framework in combination with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing activities, as proposed, would help in this way clinicians to put in play all the necessary precautionary counteractions for preventing (or at least slowing down) the spread of predicted high virulent variants..

In this study, the binding interactions between the spike RBD and ACE2 were systematically analyzed through the presented modular molecular framework for attempting to create a transmissibility, virulence and disease severity prediction tool based on the variation of the calculated spike RBD/ACE2 binding affinities, whose increase indicates more stable interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor, which might reflect an increased ability of specific variants in penetrating host-cells. We also made available for clinicians and researchers a webservice (https://www.mitoairm.it/covid19affinities), which they can easily use by uploading specific SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (or the entire spike) sequences and/or ACE2 sequences for quickly calculating the interaction energies at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface. The interaction energies calculation provides a binding affinity estimation which might be correlated to the VoC virulence/transmissibility based on the comparison with the binding affinities and interaction energies calculated at the spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface for the VoC analyzed in this manuscript. The strength of our pipeline is that it is easy to use through our webservice and gives results about the investigated interaction energies in 24–48 h for each single analysis..

One limitation is represented by the current computational power (a high number of requests would slow-down results receipt) given that the calculations are mainly performed on a small local server..

Another limitation is now represented from the fact that our pipeline was trained on mutations occurring at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Indeed, while it is expected that mutations at the RBD need to be monitored because those mutations can be responsible for an increase in the binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor, it is matter of debate the increased efficiency in entering host-cells proposed for variants showing supplementary mutations far from the RBD, i.e., D614G or P681H shown by several VoC [36] and other variants of interest or under monitoring (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/variants-concern). It is retained that mutations like D614G and P681H, being located in the N-terminal portion of the spike pre-fusion conformation, despite of their relatively great distance from the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface, can confer a different flexibility (increased for the D614G mutant and decreased for the P681H mutant) to the entire spike protein, before cleavage events determining the post-fusion conformation, following the spike N-terminal loss [7]. Indeed, it was observed that a successful interaction of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor is supported by the high flexibility of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the pre-fusion conformation, while scanning host-cell surface [8, 9]..

On this concern, a point of strength of our approach is that it can be easily adapted for estimating ACE2/spike interactions by using the entire spike protein instead of the only RBD, for investigating the effect of spike mutations occurring far from the RBD on interactions with ACE2. Furthermore, the analysis of the interactions between the entire spike protein and ACE2 would allow to evaluate the binding affinity in various combinations because it is known that the number of interacting ACE2/spike proteins might vary depending on the number of RBD in up-/down-conformation [108] (i.e., the theoretical maximum number of ACE2/spike interacting protein elements consists of 2 spike (trimeric) proteins interacting with 6 ACE2 proteins, as previously predicted [7] and then observed in the cryo-EM structure 7kni.pdb [108]). Once obtained this multi-subunit complexes, the entire protein complexes can be relaxed by using molecular dynamics [109, 110] for the following estimation of the interaction energies at the ACE2/spike protein interface. The possibility to relax and study the entire trimeric spike protein interacting with ACE2 (and/or antibodies) [7] might allow to predict more efficiently the aggressiveness of future VoC and/or their abilities in escaping vaccine induced antibodies and this would help in obtaining better predictions in the context of personalized medicine [15, 16, 111–113]. In addition, results of the analyses performed on the entire spike protein interacting with ACE2 and/or antibodies would also allow to design more efficient antibodies which will target specific portions of the spike RBD for preventing ACE2 binding, without creating at the same time undesired clashes in protein structure with different chains of the same spike trimeric protein. However, in order to perform the presented in silico binding assays by using the entire spike protein and/or the trimeric spike would surely need more computational power..

Yet, another limitation of our approach is currently represented by the need to train our simulator with a very high number of SARS-CoV-2 spike and/or ACE2 variant combinations to be analyzed and sorted by binding energies to be associated with the disease severity observed in patients who undergo SARS-CoV-2 genome (and ACE2) sequencing analysis. The association of binding energies with disease severity would help in making more accurate transmissibility, virulence and disease severity predictions based not only on the calculated interaction energies at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface, but also on the localization of the mutation and on the specific interactions that a spike variant can establish with a specific ACE2 variant..

A last point of strength of our computational approach is based on the ability of our pipeline to detect ACE2 structurally related proteins to be monitored as alternative cell-entry factors in those cells showing a low expression of ACE2. The highlighted structural relationships between ACE2, ACE, THOP1, and NLN might be useful for the scientific community that should monitor and evaluate the putative abilities of future SARS-CoV-2 variants and other related coronaviruses to use ACE2 structurally related proteins to penetrate host-cells, which might result even more dangerous due to the role of THOP1 in the regulation of MHC I cell-surface expression [105–107]..

In this study, we have presented and tested a modular molecular framework for quickly estimating the binding affinity of the human ACE2 reference protein (NP_001358344.1) for the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein variants, as sequenced from 7 VoC. Although, several single or multiple mutations at the spike RBD, as detected in the investigated VoC, did not produce an increase in the strength of interaction energies at the spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface, it was verified that particular single mutations at specific regions of the “boat-shaped” RBM, on the spike RBD, can increase the interaction energies at the protein–protein interface with ACE2. The observed higher interaction energy can implicate a greater binding affinity, which might reflect an increased ability for the analyzed VoC to penetrate host-cells..

In order to gain information about the binding affinity of new spike RBD variants for the ACE2 receptor, we would suggest using the webservice that we made available for clinicians and researchers, who can upload their sequenced RBD variants (and ACE2 variants, if possible), to calculate the interaction energies at the RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface among sequences obtained along SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing activities in patients and/or people who requested for molecular diagnosis tests..

In addition, with the right computational resources, the presented pipeline can be employed for building a library of all the possible RBD variants, which might be predicted based on solid evolutionary tools [114–116] and population genetics tools [117, 118], for trying to understand which (and where) future spike variants will appear [2, 5, 16], to quickly predict their binding affinity for the different known ACE2 variants present in the world population (i.e., see https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/gene/ENSG00000130234?dataset=exac). Thus, it would be possible to early predict which RBD variants might be more dangerous for human health even before their appearance. This would allow to prepare all the possible preventive actions in case of appearance of the worst variants, preventing the most deleterious scenarios of new outbreaks..

Furthermore, we would recommend using our webservice for the estimation of the interaction energies at the spike RBD/ACE2 protein–protein interface, for each RBD/ACE2 combination, as sequenced from patients, would allow creating a list of the RBD/ACE2 protein complexes sorted by increasing interaction energy and the corresponding degree of disease severity for each known variant combination. The interaction energy parameter, function of the disease severity for each patient, synergically with other established priority parameters [111, 119], might be used for training our pipeline to provide more and more accurate predictions about future variants transmissibility, virulence and disease severity. The early recognition of more transmissible/virulent variants would also help in assigning priority and personalized treatments to future patients, based on the specific RBD/ACE2 variants sequenced from the infected patients, by overcoming most of the contradictory results of the currently employed in vitro assays. This would also help in planning more personalized clinical treatments for those patients showing a known combination of spike/ACE2 variants, already successfully treated from other clinicians [15]. Considering this, it would be useful in the future to build a free and publicly accessible database of all the screened spike/ACE2 variant combinations (as detected from patients) with the corresponding binding affinity parameters, associated to disease severity, clinical treatments and outcome, for helping clinicians in treating patients, in accordance with the vision and attitudes of PPPM/3PM..

Variants of concern: a variant for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease, significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html).

Variants of interest: a variant with specific genetic markers that have been associated with changes to receptor binding, reduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination, reduced efficacy of treatments, potential diagnostic impact, or predicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html#Interest).
