A novel coronavirus, SARS‐CoV‐2, has caused over 274 million cases and over 5.3 million deaths worldwide since it occurred in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Here we conceptualized the temporospatial evolutionary and expansion dynamics of SARS‐CoV‐2 by taking a series of the cross‐sectional view of viral genomes from early outbreak in January 2020 in Wuhan to the early phase of global ignition in early April, and finally to the subsequent global expansion by late December 2020. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the early patients in Wuhan, Wuhan/WH04/2020 is supposed to be a more appropriate reference genome of SARS‐CoV‐2, instead of the first sequenced genome Wuhan‐Hu‐1. By scrutinizing the cases from the very early outbreak, we found a viral genotype from the Seafood Market in Wuhan featured with two concurrent mutations (i.e., M type) had become the overwhelmingly dominant genotype (95.3%) of the pandemic 1 year later. By analyzing 4013 SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes from different continents by early April, we were able to interrogate the viral genomic composition dynamics of the initial phase of global ignition over a time span of 14 weeks. Eleven major viral genotypes with unique geographic distributions were also identified. WE1 type, a descendant of M and predominantly witnessed in western Europe, consisted of half of all the cases (50.2%) at the time. The mutations of major genotypes at the same hierarchical level were mutually exclusive, which implies that various genotypes bearing the specific mutations were propagated during human‐to‐human transmission, not by accumulating hot‐spot mutations during the replication of individual viral genomes. As the pandemic was unfolding, we also used the same approach to analyze 261 323 SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes from the world since the outbreak in Wuhan (i.e., including all the publicly available viral genomes) to recapitulate our findings over 1‐year time span. By December 25, 2020, 95.3% of global cases were M type and 93.0% of M‐type cases were WE1. In fact, at present all the five variants of concern (VOC) are the descendants of WE1 type. This study demonstrates that viral genotypes can be utilized as molecular barcodes in combination with epidemiologic data to monitor the spreading routes of the pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of control measures. Moreover, the dynamics of viral mutational spectrum in the study may help the early identification of new strains in patients to reduce further spread of infection, guide the development of molecular diagnosis and vaccines against COVID‐19, and help assess their accuracy and efficacy in real world at real time..

A severe respiratory disease, named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19), has swept the globe by causing over 274 million confirmed cases (~3.6% of the world's population) and over 5.3 million deaths since it was firstly reported from Wuhan, China in early December 2019.
1
 A novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), was identified as the etiologic agent of COVID‐19.

 Genomic sequencing results indicate that the genome of SARS‐CoV‐2 is closely related to two bat‐derived SARS‐like coronaviruses, RaTG13 (with 96.2% identity) and RmYN02 (with 93.3% identity), respectively collected in 2013 and 2019 in Yunnan province, southwest China.
4
, 
5
 Phylogenetic analysis also demonstrates that SARS‐CoV‐2 is similar to the two bat‐derived SARS‐like coronaviruses but distinct from SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV.
3
, 
5
 Thus, it is speculated that bats might be the original host of SARS‐CoV‐2, and other non‐bat mammals such as pangolins might have been the intermediate reservoir.
6
 Moreover, the first reported patient cluster of COVID‐19 was epidemiologically linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China; so the market has been assumed as the origin of the outbreak by representing an intermediate reservoir of SARS‐CoV‐2.
7
 However, epidemiological evidence doubted the market was the birthplace of SARS‐CoV‐2.

 During the 2014−2015 Ebola outbreak, full‐length EBOV genome sequences from different severely stricken countries/districts in West Africa have helped us to better understand the viral evolution and transmission dynamics of the outbreak.

 Likewise, genomic studies of SARS‐CoV‐2 viral sequences may provide key insights into the transmission and evolution dynamics of the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic..

In this study, a series of cross‐sectional analyses of viral genomes by five critical time points from early outbreak to the subsequent 1‐year global expansion of the pandemic was carried out: (1) November 17, 2019 (when the patient zero presumably appeared); (2) January 1, 2020 (when the Wuhan Market was shut down); (3) January 23, 2020 (when Wuhan was locked down); (4) April 7, 2020 (early phase of global ignition); (5) December 25, 2020 (1‐year global expansion). Specifically, we firstly analyzed 4013 full‐length genome sequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 submitted to the GISAID EpiFluTM database from all over the world (N = 4002) and from the NGDC database (N = 11) in China over a 14‐week time span since the outbreak in Wuhan, China (as of April 7, 2020). By mutation‐based genotype characterization, we gain insights into the global evolutionary dynamics and genetic diversity of SARS‐CoV‐2 from the early phase of the pandemic. Moreover, we also used the same approach to analyze 261 323 full‐length SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes from all over the world over 12 months since the outbreak (i.e., including all the available viral genomes in the database as of December 25, 2020) to recapitulate those insights in parallel with the unfolding pandemic. So this study not only provides an unprecedented window into the global transmission trajectory of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the early phase but also reveals the subsequent expansion patterns of the pandemic..

We retrieved 4555 FASTA sequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and 147 FASTA viral sequences from the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC) database (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov) in China as of April 7, 2020, the first cutoff point of this study. The first sequenced viral genome Wuhan‐Hu‐1 (Genbank ID: MN908947.3) comprising 29 903 nucleotides with annotation of corresponding CDS regions was downloaded from Genbank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank) as well as the related coronavirus genome sequences from bats and pangolins..

Partial SARS‐CoV‐2 genome sequences or gene‐level‐only sequences were filtered out. Viral genome sequences from nonhuman hosts were also filtered out. Redundant sequences included in both databases, multiple samplings from the same patient, and resubmission of the identical sequences were excluded. Sequences with N for more than 3% of the total nucleotides (except 5′ and 3′ ends) were filtered out. After filtering, all the remaining sequences were mapped to the reference genome by a dual alignment software MAFFT (v7.450) which takes into consideration of both amino acid and nucleotide sequences. As the evolutionary rate of SARS‐CoV‐2 was estimated to be 27.1 subs per year (see more details in Section 3.4 of Results), and viral genomes by April 7, 2020 had only been evolved for less than half a year since the outbreak in late 2019, they were supposed to harbor mutations far less than 20 (theoretically no more than 14 mutations). Therefore, a cutoff of 20 was chosen to rigorously remove samples with low sequencing quality. After the genome sequences with >20 mismatches to the reference genome were further filtered out, a total of 4013 viral genome sequences (4002 from GISAID and 11 from NGDC) were included in this study for further analysis..

Similarly, we retrieved 290 005 FASTA sequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes from the GISAID database as of December 25, 2020, the second cutoff point of this study. Noteworthily, viral genomes by December 25, 2020 were supposed to have acquired more than 27.1 mutations since they had been evolved for over a year, and a stringent cutoff of 45 was used to discard samples with low sequencing quality. Therefore, by following the same filtering process as applied in the first cutoff point (except the genome sequences with >45 mismatches to the reference genome filtered out here), a total of 261 323 viral genome sequences were included in this study for further analysis..

To find evolutionarily related coronavirus with SARS‐CoV‐2, the first sequenced viral genome sequence (Genbank ID: MN908947.3) was used to perform BLAST via NCBI betacoronavirus sequence data set (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Nine coronavirus sequences from bats sharing the highest genomic identity with MN908947.3 were selected and downloaded. In addition, nine coronavirus sequences from pangolins (available at GISAID) were also selected to align with MN908947.3. Phylogenetic tree analysis was conducted with the neighbor‐joining method in MEGA‐X (v10.0) based on the alignment results. Six sequences (three from bats and three from pangolins) that are most proximate to MN908947.3 in the tree were chosen for nucleotide alignment at the orthologous sites of 8782 base and 28 144 base with the sequences of nine early Wuhan cases (eight linked with the Market and one not related to the Market).

.

A previously published software named Augur was used to perform sequence data filtering and multiple sequence alignment.
13
 Specifically, for each viral genome sequence, the first 150 bases at 5′ end and 80 bases at the 3′ end were omitted, and the ambiguous bases were ignored. Next, multiple sequence alignment with reference genome sequence MN908947.3 was performed for each genome. If a particular base of a genome was different from the one of reference genome at the same genomic position, it was defined as a mutation. After mutation detection, the mutation profiles of each sample were first converted into a matrix of 0 or 1 at each genomic position, where 1 meant a mutation was detected. Mutation matrices for all samples were used to perform the hierarchical clustering analysis via the Pheatmap (v1.0.12) package of R. This method was chosen over phylogenetics because the latter was heavily dependent on reliable rooting, which is challenging for SARS‐CoV‐2 given a relatively short time period of evolution. On the contrary, the principle of hierarchical clustering analysis is to put together samples with identical mutations to minimize the total branch length, and therefore it is hardly interfered with by rooting and is very straightforward for analyzing the genomes of etiologic pathogens from a new outbreak like COVID‐19..

After hierarchical clustering analysis, a sanity check for each of the major clusters was performed by extracting the decisive concomitant mutations and masking the nondecisive random mutations. Finally, 11 major genotypes were selected from clustering analysis and defined in the Pedigree chart (Figure 4B). Samples with mutation profiles matching to any of the 11 defined genotypes were classified into the corresponding types, whereas samples with mutation profiles not fitting into any defined genotypes were assigned as Others. Samples with no mutations under the aforementioned mutation calling methods were defined as ancestral type..

By the first cutoff date (April 7, 2020), we identified the two most abundant substitutions, C/T at location 8782 base (orf1ab: C8517T, synonymous) and T/C at location 28 144 base (ORF8: T251C, L84S) from 4013 viral genomes. The T8782 and C28144 genotypes were found to coexist in 767 (19.1%) genomes, whereas the remaining 3246 genomes (80.9%) were consistent with the first sequenced SARS‐CoV‐2 genome, Wuhan‐Hu‐1 (MN908947.3) at those two sites.

.

Next, to address the question of whether those two sites are evolutionarily conserved, we generated a phylogenetic tree of the eight patient samples linked with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (hereinafter named as the Market) and the related coronaviruses from animal reservoirs by nucleotide sequence alignment.
7
, 
14
 Interestingly, we found the most related coronaviruses from pangolins and bats showed consensus at the orthologous sites of 8782 base as T and 28 144 base as C. A complete linkage at both sites was also observed in these highly related coronaviruses including the most closely related bat coronavirus RaTG13 (96.2% identical) (Figure 1). This result suggests that the T8782 and C28144 genotype existing in 19.1% of SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes is more conserved during evolution as an ancestral genotype. On the opposite, the samples from the eight patients demonstrate identical concurrent mutations on those two sites (T8782C and C28144T). Coincidentally, all eight patients had worked or visited the Market before the onset of illness. Also worth mentioning is that the patient of sample Wuhan/WH04/2020 did not visit the market but stayed in a hotel nearby between December 23 and 27, 2019.
2
, 
7
 Different from the aforementioned eight Market samples, the genotype of this patient sample showed no mutations on the two sites (i.e., T8782 and C28144), suggesting this patient had been infected from somewhere else in Wuhan instead of the Market. Noteworthily, the first sequenced SARS‐CoV‐2 genome, Wuhan‐Hu‐1 which was from a worker at the Market, also acquired the two point mutations.
2
 Based on the analysis above, the most recent common ancestor of the SARS‐CoV‐2 should be Wuhan/WH04/2020 instead of Wuhan‐Hu‐1, although it was first sequenced.
15
 Therefore, Wuhan/WH04/2020 was used as the reference genome for all subsequent analyses in the study..

Sequence alignment of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the most related coronaviruses from animal reservoirs at locations 8782 and 28 144. The 20 base frank sequences of site 8782 and 28 144 (indicated with a red triangle) from eight COVID‐19 samples linked with the Market, one sample not directly linked with the Market (Wuhan/WH04/2020) (marked with red arrow), and seven closely related virus samples from bats and pangolins were aligned with Wuhan/WH04/2020. The first sequenced genome, Wuhan‐Hu‐1, was marked with a red star. Bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 is the closest coronavirus to SARS‐CoV‐2 with an overall 3.8% genomic difference. SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2.

Given limited sampling of viruses from the Market, we acknowledge that samples with concurrent T8782 and C28144 genotypes from the Market might have been underrepresented. However, we are confident that a significant portion of samples from the Market was derived from an ancestral genotype, generating a distinctive genotype defined by two concurrent mutations, which we named as M type (T8782C/C28144T) hereinafter. Based on the early samples available in the study, M type might have represented an overwhelming majority of all COVID‐19 samples since the initial phase of the global pandemic although it should be drawn with caution that other viral types might have been underrepresented due to the potential sampling bias (Figure S1). All the 16 samples collected before January 1, 2020 have the M‐type mutations that coincide with the fact that market contact history was one of the diagnostic criteria of COVID‐19 at the period of time (Table S1).

.

Early cases reported from Wuhan were extremely critical to answer how the outbreak took place at the very beginning. In this study, we were able to collate 34 viral genomes sampled from Wuhan between December 24, 2019 and January 18, 2020, although the number of confirmed cases by then was 121 according to Chinese officials (Figure 2). There were two distinct clusters of the 34 early samples. Thirty out of 34 viral genomes were categorized into the M type (T8782C/C28144T) with a great extent of genetic diversity. Among these 30 genomes, 17 acquired extra mutations apart from two M‐type mutations resulting in 14 different genotypes. All of the 11 viral genomes linked with the Market (including 8 samples of patients who had visited the Market and 3 positive environmental samples collected from the Market) were in this cluster.
7
 Although the M type was the dominant type during the early outbreak of COVID‐19 in Wuhan, the non‐Market genotypes from four patients form the second cluster that also coexisted with M‐type cluster at that time. Two of them were ancestral type and the other two had their own unique mutations. Wuhan/WH04/2020 was a patient who had no direct Market exposure in the second cluster.
7
 Taken together, these findings imply that the genetic pool of SARS‐CoV‐2 was already very diversified during the early outbreak in Wuhan as there were 18 different genotypes in total among the 34 early samples from Wuhan. The super‐dominant Market lineage might have been initially transmitted to the market by a primary patient case infected with the M‐type virus. M‐type virus was rapidly propagated within the Market which had served as a big incubator of the outbreak considering its huge size (~50 000 square meters and ~1000 booths). This notion is also evidenced by the three positive environmental samples (Wuhan/IVDC‐HB‐envF13/2020, Wuhan/IVDC‐HB‐envF13‐20/2020, and Wuhan/IVDC‐HB‐envF13‐21/2020) collected from the booths and garbage truck of the Market on January 1, 2020 by China CDC. The viral genotypes of three environmental samples were also M type. In fact, 33 out of 585 environmental samples from the Market were tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 according to an investigation conducted by China CDC in January 2020..

Mutation profiles of 34 early samples from Wuhan. Each vertical stripe indicates a sample. The greenish horizontal stripe at the top indicates the time interval in week(s) between the date of sample emergence and December 23, 2020 (the starting date of Week 1): the darker the green, the later the sample emerged. The horizontal stripe in the second row indicates the sample location: samples linked with the Market were indicated as orange. Specific mutations harbored by each sample were indicated as red.

Before jumping to any conclusive summary of the mutation spectrum of SARS‐CoV‐2 genome, the potential impact of sequencing errors on mutation calling in this study should be cautiously addressed. To estimate the magnitude of bias that may be introduced by sequencing errors, we firstly filtered out low‐quality sequence data to ensure the high quality of the analyzed genome sequences. The samples with only one of the concurrent mutations of M type at either position 8782 base or 28 144 base were regarded as the consequence of sequencing/assembling errors since the co‐mutations on the two sites were interrupted. Thus these samples were used to exemplify the maximum sequencing errors that can be anticipated. Sixteen out of 4013 genomes bore only one of the two concurrent M‐type mutations, and six of the 16 demonstrated an ambiguous base (N or “Y”) at the inconsistent site. So there were supposed to be at most 10 genomes unambiguously bearing the correspondence of sequencing errors at either of the two sites in the 4013 genomes. For simplicity, we assumed sequencing errors occurred randomly along the viral genome so that the maximum sequencing error rate for each base per genome can be calculated as 10/2/4013 = 0.00125. And the error rate was further divided by 3 given that each base was equiprobably recognized as one of the three erroneous bases (e.g., A ⟶ C, A ⟶ T, A ⟶ G), resulting in a final error rate of 0.00042. Based on this estimation, we can assume if any single mutation observed in this study had been caused by a sequencing error, it was supposed to be found in no more than 1.68 genomes (calculated as 4013 genomes multiplied by 0.00042). Similarly, among 4013 genomes in the study, less than 0.001 genome was anticipated to erroneously acquire two concurrent mutations such as M type by sequencing errors (calculated as 4013 genomes multiplied by 0.00042^2)..

As the evolutionary rate of SARS‐CoV‐2 was estimated to be 27.1 subs per year (see more details in the next section of Results), it may take 3321 years (30 000 × 3 possible alternative bases/27.1 bases per year) for a viral genome to generate one identical mutation with another one solely through viral error‐prone replication process. Thus, less than one (0.4) out of 4013 viral genomes was anticipated to acquire one identical mutation with another one by random mutation events during the past 4 months (calculated as 4013 genomes divided by 3321 years and multiplied by 1/3 year). In addition, as indicated previously, among the 4013 viral genomes, less than 0.001 genome was anticipated to acquire two concurrent mutations as M type by sequencing errors. It reinforced the notion that identical genotypes of any multitude observed in the study were very unlikely to have been caused by coincidence but resulted from lateral human‐to‐human transmission..

As described above, sequencing errors were very unlikely to confound the mutation analyses of 4013 genomes. A total of 2954 unique nucleotide substitutions were identified from the 4013 SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes with relatively even distribution across the viral genome (Table S1). On average, there are 7.4 ± 3.4 (mean ± SD) mutations per genome. Only 31 genomes had no mutation (i.e., ancestral type), while 952 (32.2%) mutations were recurrent in more than one sample..

Mutations increased in individual samples during the course of evolution by plotting the number of mutations per sample with the time of sample emergence (Figure S2). Samples with more mutations were collected at a relatively later stage. A simple linear regression of the root‐to‐tip genetic distances against the sampling dates was performed to estimate the evolutionary rate of SARS‐CoV‐2 using the TempEst (v1.5.3) software. The evolutionary rate was estimated to be 27.1 subs per year, which was very similar to the evolutionary rate (26.7 subs per year) estimated by Nextstrain.org from 4616 viral genomes sampled between December 2019 and April 2020 (https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global?l=clock)..

There were 17 mutations that occurred in more than 10% samples (Figure 3A and Table S1). Like M‐type T8782C/C28144T mutations, concurrent mutations were also observed from the other 15 most frequent single nucleotide mutations. A symmetric matrix plot by clustering analysis was generated from the 17 most frequent mutations to highlight the most common concurrent mutations (Figure 3B). T8782C/C28144T were concurrent in 81% samples, followed by C14408T/A23403G/C3037T/C241T (51%), G28881A/G28882A/G28883C (16%), C1059T/G25563T (12%), C17747T/A17858G/C18060T (12%), and G11083T/C14805T/G26144T (8%). G28881A/G28882A/G28883C and C1059T/G25563T were intersecting with C14408T/C241T/C3037T/A23403G since both were subsequent mutations of C14408T/C241T/C3037T/A23403G (Figure 3B,C). Likewise, C14408T/C241T/C3037T/A23403G and G11083T/C14805T/G26144T were intersecting with T8782C/C28144T since both were subsequent mutations of T8782C/C28144T. C17747T/A17858G/C18060T did not intersect with any other concurrent mutations since it was a genotype derived directly from ancestral type and independent to T8782C/C28144T (M type) (Figure 3B,C)..

Concurrence and relationships of the 17 most frequent mutations. (A) Frequency histogram of common mutations identified 4013 virus genomes (as of April 7, 2020). Mutations that were shared by at least 10% of samples were ranked from the most common (left) to least common (right) mutations. (B) Symmetric matrix of concurrence rate of 17 most frequent mutations among all samples. The number within each box represented the percentage of samples possessing the intersecting mutations against all samples. (C) Venn diagram showing the subsequence relationships of the 17 most frequent mutations.

Nine hundred and fifty‐two mutations (32.2%) spread at least once as they were detected in more than one patient sample, and distinct genotypes can be characterized based on the prevalence of mutations (Table S1) to identify “super spreaders” with particular genotypes, who to a great extent determined the scale and trend of the ongoing pandemic. Super spreader genotype was methodically defined as the basal outbreak variant possessing certain common mutations, which caused the outbreak with a single introduction and subsequently transmission and evolution..

The biggest super spreader genotype was the variant carrying M‐type (T8782C/C28144T) mutations, which was spread into 3246 patients, counting for 80.9% of the cases in the study (Figure S1). It may be worth pondering whether this “founder effect” was attributed to a single super spreader or a multitude of coincidentally identical super spreaders. Based on our aforementioned estimation, the chance to have a multitude of identical mutations by coincidence or sequencing error was next to none. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that the patient clusters from the Market in Wuhan during the early outbreak were very likely to be the descendants from literally one single ancestor, who might have been a vendor or a regular customer and probably spread the virus at the Market late November or early December according to the limited epidemiologic data..

In contrast, only 10 patients (0.2%) had unique genotypes that none of their mutations were identified from a second sample within the 4013 viral genomes (i.e., singletons) (Tables S1 andS2). It means the 10 patients had not spread their viruses based on the sampled viral genomes in the early phase of the pandemic. Based on the epidemiological data, 7 of the 10 cases were reported from China and the other 3 were reported from Singapore. All of them were sampled by February 2020 except two cases from Singapore were sampled in March 2020..

To trace the temporospatial transmission and regional expansion of the pandemic, we conducted mutation‐based unsupervised clustering of all the samples. As shown in Figure 4A, the 4013 samples were largely grouped by their mutation profiles. Based on the clustering result, a pedigree chart of the five‐level hierarchy was manually curated and illustrated to show how the most dominant descendant genotypes were derived from the ancestral genome of SARS‐CoV‐2 at the Level 0 of the hierarchy (Figures 4B and S3). Six descendant genotypes, namely M type (concurrent T8782C/C28144T) starting from the Market, SEA type (concurrent C17747T/A17858G/C18060T) initially reported solely from the Greater Seattle area in the United States, ES type (concurrent T9477A/G25979T/C28657T/C28863T) with more than 60% of cases reported from Spain, AU2 type (concurrent C24034T/T26729C/G28077C) with 22 out of 41 cases reported from Australia, GD type (C29095T) initially found in Guangdong Province, and BJ/KR type (12 cases with concurrent T4402C/G5062T mutations) reported from both Beijing and South Korea, were directly derived from the ancestral genome by acquiring corresponding mutations, and thus represented Level 1 of the hierarchy (Supporting Information Results)..

Major genotypes identified in the study. (A) Unsupervised mutation clustering of all samples. Mutations concurrently called from at least five samples were included. Eleven distinctive major mutation profiles were identified based on clustering tree branches and were named mainly based on the geographic locations where a certain genotype was initially or mainly reported from. The two‐letter ISO country codes were used to indicate the countries associated with the mutation profiles (as shown at the lower color bar). The upper color bar demonstrates genotypic homogeneity within each clustering tree branch. (B) Pedigree chart of major genotypes. In combination with mutation clustering and available epidemiologic information, 11 distinctive main genotypes were characterized and the pedigree chart demonstrated the relationship of each genotype. The genotypes from Diamond Princess and Grand Princess derived from M type and SEA type, respectively, were indicated with dashed arrows. (C) Mutual exclusivity among the major genotypes of Level 1 (M, SEA, ES, AU2, GD, and BJ/KR) and Level 2 (WE1, SG/WE2, DE, AU1, and NL). M‐Others: the other minor genotypes in Level 2. See also Figure S3
.

Five descendant genotypes (WE1, SG/WE2, DE, NL, AU1) were further derived from the M type, consisting of Level 2 of the hierarchy. In particular, the most prevalent descendant genotype of M, WE1 type (named as Western European 1) represented a total of 2016 cases, a half of all the cases (50.2%) in the study. Over 70% of WE1 cases were reported from Western European countries, with the United Kingdom (19.2%), Iceland (11.8%), Belgium (9.7%), France (8.5%), and Netherlands (5.0%) being the major contributors. The WE1 type was featured by four concurrent mutations (C241T/C3037T/C14408T/A23403G). Given geographic proximity among those countries, cross‐border virus traffic might have occurred, leading to the widespread transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 in Western Europe. WE1 also represented 34.8% of the cases in the United States. Interestingly, among 4013 samples, we found three early samples carrying three out of the four mutations of WE1 (C241T/C3037T/A23403G), with two (one from Germany and one from Shanghai) sampled on January 28, 2020 and one from Shanghai sampled on January 31, 2020. The one from Germany belonged to the first COVID‐19 cluster reported from Bavaria, Germany, which was associated with a primary case with previous travel history from Wuhan.
16

.

SG/WE2 type was characterized by a single common mutation (G26144T) and was first reported from Singapore and several Western European countries (the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, and Netherlands). All early cases of the DE type (featured with concurrent G1440A/G2891A) were found in Germany; however, the majority (62.6%) of DE cases were reported from the United Kingdom. NL type was mainly reported from the Netherlands and featured with a single extra mutation, T514C. AU1 type was mainly found in Australia with three extra concurrent mutations (G1397A/T28688C/G29742T)..

Figure S4 illustrated the temporal expansion of the 11 major genotypes over a 14‐week time span. M type remained as the overwhelmingly dominant genotype from the very beginning of the outbreak to early April. WE1 was spread to more than half of the total cases as of April 7, becoming the most prevailing M‐derived genotype in the globe. Next to WE1 type, SG/WE2 type was spread to 11.1% of the global population. The major non‐M type, SEA type, initially reported from the Greater Seattle area, was spread to 11.8% of the global population. Moreover, genotypic compositions of SARS‐CoV‐2 in different countries and geographic locations were able to indicate genotypic‐epidemiologic relevance (Supporting Information Results, Figures S5
−
S7)..

Interestingly, as shown in Figure 4C, six Level 1 genotypes (M, SEA, ES, AU2, GD, and BJ/KR) derived directly from ancestral type were mutually exclusive, and five Level 2 genotypes derived from M type (WE1, SG/WE2, DE, AU1, and NL) were mutually exclusive as well. It implies mutations occurred randomly and independently in the genome of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the various genotypes carrying specific mutations were propagated during human‐to‐human transmission, not by accumulating hot‐spot mutations during the replication of individual viral genomes. This also reflects the high quality of sequencing data applied in the study (after filtering out low‐quality sequence data) and the randomness of the mutations occurring across the viral genome..

By taking into account all of the well‐defined 11 major genotypes from Levels 1 and 2 in the study, we developed an algorithm, SOO, to match a particular SARS‐CoV‐2 viral genome to the known genotypes based on its mutation profile. The concordance of SOO was estimated in comparison with mutation clustering by assigning each of the 4013 samples included in the study to the corresponding genotype (Figure 5). The overall concordance of genotypes assigned by SOO with those assigned by mutation clustering was 89.8%. Within Level 1 genotypes, the concordance ranged from 84.9% to 100.0% with an overall concordance of 86.5%. All the Level 2 genotypes represented major subtypes of M type and the overall concordance with clustering results at this level was 90.5%. The most abundant genotype at Level 2, WE1 showed 93.4% concordance. Thus, SOO represents a more accurate approach to define genotypes as it only takes into consideration the specific mutations of the particular genotypes with little influence from the rest random mutations..

There were seven phylogenetic clades of 5139 virus genomes sampled between December 2019 and September 2020 in GISAID global analysis (https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/hcov-19-genomic-epidemiology/) (Table S3). Since genomes were equally subsampled from each admin division per month, it should be acknowledged that countries with massive viral genome submissions might have been underrepresented. Thus conclusions regarding the global vision of the pandemic based on the GISAID global analysis should be drawn with caution..

Four clades (n = 4077, 79.3%) from GISAID were well defined by the SOO classification (Table S4). The three most prevalent clades GR (n = 1726, 33.6%), G (n = 1252, 24.4%) and GH (n = 977, 19.0%) were descendent from WE1 (n = 3955, 77.0%), with GR referred to WE1.1, GH referred to WE1.2, and G referred to WE1 others by SOO classification. Moreover, V (n = 122, 2.4%) was referred to SG/WE2 by SOO. Two other clades cannot be directly referred to any SOO genotypes although L can be vaguely inferred as ancestral type and others, S be inferred as a mixture of non‐M types including SEA, ES, AU2, and GD. On the other hand, the O (n = 500, 9.7%) clade cannot be equivocally inferred as any SOO genotypes. It is plausible since it was not presented as a unique branch as other clades but scattered all over other branches of the phylogeny, implying it was not a well‐defined unique clade..

We analyzed all the available SARS‐CoV‐2 viral genomes in the GISAID database as of December 25, 2020, the second cutoff date of the study. A total of 10 392 unique nucleotide substitutions were identified from the 261 323 SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes (Table S5), which indicates roughly one out of three nucleotides in the viral genomes has mutated during the 12‐month time span of the viral evolution. A pedigree chart of the 100 most abundant mutations was generated to highlight the lineages of the most common concurrent mutations during the 12‐month time window of the unfolding pandemic (Figure 6 and Table S6). A very tiny proportion (92 genomes, less than 0.04%) of viral genomes were ancestral type. Fifty‐nine (64.1%) of them were reported from China between January and March 2020, among which seven were sampled from Wuhan in January 2020 (Table S7). Despite the overwhelming dominance of M type (95.3%), other major genotypes at Level 1 hierarchy in the early phase gradually faded out as the pandemic unfolds (Figures 3B, 6 and Table S6). For example, SEA type was one of the most common viral genotypes in early April, accounting for 11.8% of the total samples. However, the percentage of SEA type drastically dropped to only 1.0% by the end of December (Figure 6 and Table S6). Moreover, the proportion of other non‐M mutations (ES, AU2, GD, and BJ/KR) at Level 1 were too small to be listed within the 100 most common mutations (Figure 6). Similarly, WE1 (88.6%) was still the major subtype of M (accounting for 93.0% of M) while other subtypes (SG/WE2, DE, AU1, and NL) at Level 2 gradually faded out. But still, four subtypes of WE1, namely WE1.1 (34.3%), WE1.2 (19.3%), WE1.3 (22.2%), and WE1.4 (6.1%) were reasonably represented. On the other hand, a subtype of WE1, named WE1.5 (19.9%), featured with additional seven concurrent mutations (T445C/C6286T/G21255C/C22227T/C26801G/C28932T/G29645T) had not emerged by early April but came to the surface during the subsequent expansion. Interestingly, the one‐time concurrence of more than four mutations like WE1.5 was seldom represented in the early viral samples but was more frequently observed in the later‐phase samples (Figure 6)..

To visualize the pandemic expansion patterns in the world over a significant one‐year time window, we analyzed time‐series genotypic compositions of SARS‐CoV‐2 at critical time points to try to piece the puzzle together (Figure 7, Tables S1 and S5). First, to better fathom the whole story, a putative “patient zero” harboring an ancestral viral genotype was added to build the first time point as November 17, 2019, on which date the earliest patient ever documented can be traced back to.
17
 A total of 19 viral genomes were sampled by January 1, 2020, all of which were M type. As discussed before, the M‐type cases had been populating at the Market for several weeks before it was shut down on January 1, 2020, resulting in an absolute overrepresentation of M‐type samples by this date. As the virus kept unfolding in Wuhan, the city was locked down on January 23, 2020. Eighty of 104 (76.9%) viral samples by then were M type. Population mobility from Wuhan before its lockdown (most likely during the Spring Festival travel rush) may have caused the subsequent national‐wide epidemic in China and ultimately the global pandemic. By April 7, 2020, over 80% of global cases were still M type. Noteworthily, a descendant genotype from M, WE1 type accounted for over a half of global cases. It firstly swept Western Europe in mid‐February and later the United States in late February, and became the most prevailing type worldwide. By December 25, 2020, 95.3% of global cases were M type and 93.0% of M‐type cases were WE1, from which five VOCs were subsequently derived. The current overwhelming dominance of M (particularly one subtype WE1) and its continuous expansion were well captured and characterized throughout the study..

Snapshots of genotypic compositions of SARS‐CoV‐2 at five critical time points. Genotypic compositions of genomes sampled by the dates of the first case ever reported, market shutdown, Wuhan lockdown, the first data lock, and the second data lock of this study were analyzed. SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2.

Thus, the M‐type expansion pattern well represented the pandemic expansion pattern: patient zero (November 17, 2019, unknown%) → Market (January 1, 2020, 100%) → Wuhan (January 23, 2020, 76.9%) → World (April 7, 2020, 80.9%; December 25, 2020, 95.3%)..

Recently, there have been five VOC that draw tremendous public attention due to increased transmissibility or virulence that may attenuate the effectiveness of current control measures, available diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. In May 2021, the WHO has officially renamed the four VOCs based on the Greek alphabet for purposes of public discourse, in which the UK variant N501Y V1 (i.e., B.1.1.7) was named Alpha, and the South Africa variant N501Y V2 (i.e., B.1.351) was named Beta. The two other VOCs were Gamma (i.e., P.1), the variant first identified in Brazil, and Delta (i.e., B.1.617.2) that originated in India.
18
 In this study, a total of 4130 viral genomes harbored N501Y by December 25, 2020. Interestingly, they were generally categorized into two strains, with 3931 genomes as a subtype of WE1.1, and 188 genomes as a subtype of WE1.2 under the SOO algorithm (Figure 8A), with the former mainly reported from the United Kingdom (98.5%) and the latter mostly reported from South Africa (96.3%). It was consistent with a previous report from WHO that the UK variant N501Y V1 (i.e., B.1.1.7) was a different virus variant from the one from South Africa N501Y V2 (i.e., B.1.351) by phylogenetic analysis.
19
 Interestingly the first genome of V1 in GISAID was from Victoria, Australia on June 3, 2020. A total of 31 V1 genomes were identified in June 2020, 30 of which were from Australia. This gave rise to the first wave of V1 in June. It was followed by a huge spike beginning in November 2020 which was attributed to the wide spread of V1 in the United Kingdom at that time (Figure 8B). The first genome of V2 was actually from New York City, USA on April 21, 2020, and V2 was later widely spread in South Africa as evidenced by a wave of V2 in November (Figure 8B). In contrast, neither Gamma nor Delta variants were found in the 261 323 viral genomes by December 25, 2020 in this study, which is plausible since they emerged later than the Alpha and Beta variants..

Emergence of VOCs. (A) The UK variant (N501Y V1) and the South Africa variant (N501Y V2) were classified as two different strains by SOO. Percentages within the brackets indicate the number of each variant genomes against a total of 261 323 genomes as of December 25, 2020. (B) The monthly frequency of V1 and V2 from April to December 2020. (C) The four VOCs were classified by SOO. Percentages within the brackets indicate the number of each variant's genomes against a total of 2 365 392 genomes as of July 15, 2021. (D) The five VOCs were classified by SOO. Percentages within the brackets indicate the number of each variant's genomes against a total of 6 040 117 genomes as of December 20, 2021. SOO, strain of origin; VOC, variants of concern .

Next, to bridge the latest consequential situation of VOCs to what have been recapitulated in the 1‐year pandemic in the study, two post hoc analyses of the VOCs under the SOO algorithm were performed. We found that all the VOCs were subtypes of WE1 (Figure 8C,D). As of July 15, 2021, the Alpha variant was the most prevailing (42.5%) VOC and a subtype of WE1.1 in parallel with Gamma which was much less prevalent (2.2%). The Beta variant, on the other hand, was a subtype of WE1.2.1, with the least prevalence (1.2%) (Figure 8C). Interestingly, a recent study identified that a selectively convergent 501Y meta‐signature may have granted Alpha, Beta, and Gamma fitness advantage.
20
 The Delta variant was derived from WE1, a subtype not characterized by the SOO algorithm, which was understandable given that it emerged much later than the second cutoff date of the study. Although it accounted for a moderate amount (8.1%), it has been worrisome since its first emergence because it has been spreading faster than the other variants.
21
, 
22
 Moreover, featured with amino acid changes at the N‐terminal domain and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, Delta variant has shown increased immune evasion potential.
22
 Its ability to escape from natural immunity was further verified by the second post hoc analysis in the study as of December 20, 2021 (Figure 8D). Currently, Delta has outpaced Alpha (18.9%) and is the most prevalent (58.3%) VOC while the proportion of both Beta (0.7%) and Gamma (1.9%) remains relatively insignificant. More recently, on November 26, 2021, a newly emerging variant B.1.1.529 from South Africa was designated as a novel VOC and named Omicron by WHO. This novel variant is depicted as a subtype of WE1.1 alongside Alpha and Gamma in the study (Figure 8D). Although remaining a tiny percentage (0.2%) of a total of 6 040 117 genomes in GISAID as of December 20, 2021, Omicron has recently aroused an unprecedented panic all over the world. It is a highly divergent variant with a high number of mutations, including at least 30 amino acid substitutions, three small deletions, and one small insertion in the spike protein. Fifteen of the 30 amino acid substitutions are in the RBD, which may be associated with humoral immune escape potential and higher transmissibility. It has been evidenced to have a substantial growth advantage over Delta.
23
, 
24
 Meanwhile, the clinical severity of Omicron, especially the severity profile by vaccination and preexisting immunity, is yet to be elucidated..

It has been over 23 months since Chinese health authorities first reported patient cases with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
3
 As the pandemic continues, to mitigate the risk of further regional expansions as well as to estimate the effectiveness of control measures in various regions, research on its origins, transmission routes, and expansion models have begun to surge..

We acknowledge that the discrepancy of the frequency and scale of sampling/sequencing/submission of viral genomes to the GISAID database among different geographic locations/countries might have introduced sampling bias in the study. Although the publicly available SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes included in this study are not sampled in strict proportion to the real‐time global burden of COVID‐19, however, we provide a global view of how the mutation patterns of the SARS‐CoV‐2 genome vary over time in different countries and regions, which can shed light on the underlying temporospatial transmission and expansion pattern of COVID‐19 worldwide. This is hitherto the largest and the most comprehensive SARS‐CoV‐2 viral genome study and molecular epidemiology study since the COVID‐19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. The 14‐week time span since the outbreak gives us a critical time window to study the mutation profiles and molecular evolution of SARS‐CoV‐2 at the initial stage of the pandemic..

SARS‐CoV‐2 virus is a positive‐sense single‐stranded RNA ((+)ssRNA) virus with a 30‐kb genome, and like most other RNA viruses such as Ebola virus, SARS‐CoV‐2 can also quickly generate mutations through error‐prone replication.

 Considerable mutation events can be anticipated during the transmission and replication of the ongoing SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak. Several studies on the genomics of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus have offered clues of the origins, and transmission path of the disease. However, due to lack of early samples, a limited number of SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes and/or focusing on specific geographic locations,

 a complete global view of viral genomes in the context of their mutational spectrum is yet to be elucidated from any previous SARS‐CoV‐2 studies. In this study, we used a unique mutation‐based hierarchical clustering approach rather than conventional phylogenetics to interrogate the genomic and evolutionary dynamics of SARS‐CoV‐2 worldwide over a 1‐year time window. The principle of this method is to put together samples with identical mutations to minimize the total branch length. Moreover, by using stringent quality checks to filter out potential sequencing/assembling errors, the mutation‐based clustering further enabled us to differentiate the real mutation patterns from potential random noises in the viral genome..

The very early cases of COVID‐19, especially those linked to the Market, were the key to revealing the origin, the transmission paths as well as the evolution of the virus. Unfortunately, the viral samples and epidemiologic data from the early outbreak were largely mutilated. Here we meticulously collected the genomic data of the early cases from different databases and combed through the clinical data of those cases by not only in‐depth review of early publications, but also collecting the viral sequences not included in GISAID, reading news reports and social media in China, and by contacting the researchers who worked on the early cases directly. We were able to collate 34 invaluable early cases from Wuhan including the cases of the patient cluster from the Seafood Market. The genetic diversity observed from the early Wuhan cases suggests the transmission had already been ongoing for some time at an inconspicuous pace before the clustered cases emerging from the Market were reported. The speculation can be reinforced by a report that the earliest patient can be traced back to November 17, 2019.

.

Based on our time‐series genotypic composition analysis, a super spreader genotype, M type, had ignited the COVID‐19 outbreak from the Market. The transmission continued for a few weeks or so without effective control measures until the final shutdown of the Market on January 1, 2020.
9
 As a consequence, the Market, with tens of thousands of people (workers and customers) in and out every day, became an incubator that catalyzed the propagation of the M type in Wuhan during the early outbreak. Based on our lineage analysis, we can also conclude the explosion of the M type is the largest driving force for the global pandemic. However, it should be pointed out that this study is not equipped to address the natural origin of SARS‐CoV‐2 since there were no intermediate samples to link the most closely related bat coronavirus RaTG13 and human SARS‐CoV‐2. In contrast to the super spreading M type, 10 patients (7 of which were reported from China by February 2020) failed to spread their viruses to a second person by early April 2020 so that they harbored very unique “singleton” viral genotypes. We doubt that those singleton types had different transmissibility from M type due to their unique mutation profiles because in the early phase of the pandemic, few mutations were epidemiologically significant and the evolutionary dynamics of the virus were predominantly characterized by a mutational pattern of slow and selectively neutral random genetic drift.
20
 The predominance of a particular viral genotype such as M type at the beginning of a pandemic is more likely to be attributable to the “founder's effect” than the fitness of the virus..

The sequential increment of concurrent mutations from early lineages to descendant lineages as the pandemic unfolds still remains as an enigma. This phenomenon can be exemplified with M type. It initiated with two concurrent mutations followed by acquiring four concurrent mutations to become WE1, and further obtained three concurrent mutations to become WE1.1. Although it is roughly consistent with the estimated evolutionary rate (~22 subs per year according to Nextstrain by December 2020), the underlying mechanism of those sequential increments of concurrent mutations is yet to be carefully unveiled..

Interestingly, we found that all five VOCs were subtypes of WE1. Although the Alpha variant, a subtype of WE1.1, was the most prevailing VOC several months ago, the Delta variant, a subtype of WE1, outpaced Alpha (18.9%) and is the most prevalent (58.3%) VOC while the proportion of both Beta (0.7%) and Gamma (1.9%) remains relatively insignificant. Recent studies have demonstrated Delta variant spread is associated with an escape to antibodies targeting non‐RBD and RBD Spike epitopes.
21
, 
22
 Yet more mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate how it will affect the effectiveness of current control measures, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. The most recent VOC, Omicron, is a subtype of WE1.1 alongside Alpha and Gamma in the study, and only remained a tiny percentage (0.2%) in the GISAID as of December 20, 2021. Omicron has made the world panic‐stricken because of the deletions and more than 30 mutations of Omicron that have increased transmissibility, higher viral binding affinity, and higher antibody escape.
23
, 
24
 Although the Omicron variant is proved to be detectable on widely used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, the effects of most of the remaining Omicron mutations as well as the impact of Omicron on clinical presentation are not yet available to provide definitive evidence, resulting in uncertainty about viral behavior, susceptibility to natural and vaccine‐mediated immunity as well as the efficacy of current treatment strategies to patients with Omicron.

.

As many Emergency Use Authorized (EUA) real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) diagnostic tests for SARS‐CoV‐2 have been widely used all over the world to screen for infected COVID‐19 patients, various genomic regions were chosen by different agencies and manufacturers to design primers for the tests. For example, the three target regions of the diagnostic kit developed by US CDC are within the N region, whereas the test that China CDC developed for the initial investigation in Wuhan targeted ORF1ab as well as the N region, which is similar to the test used in Singapore.
3
, 
30
 On the other hand, many manufacturers' tests chose to target the S gene. For example, the Thermo Fisher Scientific and Applied DNA Sciences tests target the S gene. Thermo's test also targets the N and ORF1ab genes, while Applied DNA's test targets two regions in the S gene.
31
 Since genetic variants of SARS‐CoV‐2 arise regularly, those tests may give rise to potential false‐negative results due to the mutations in the viral genome. A few tests have been reported with false‐negative issues like S‐gene dropout or reduced sensitivity with the S‐gene target in detecting variants with N501Y mutation.
31
 Not to mention tests detecting a single target in the viral genome which may generate far more variable and equivocal results. Although tests with multiple genetic targets to determine a final result are less likely to be impacted by increased prevalence of genetic variants, ongoing analyses of viral genomes in a real‐time fashion may help with early identification of new stains in patients to reduce further spread of infection, guide the development and assess the efficacy of SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines.
32
 Based on the viral mutation spectrum and evolutionary rate estimation in the study, it is evident that the common mutation loci should be avoided as targets when designing RT and PCR primers for SARS‐CoV‐2 tests. Similarly, when developing nucleotide‐based vaccines of SARS‐CoV‐2, researchers should take into consideration the mutation frequency in selecting viral genomic regions encoding antigen epitopes. Finally, it is imperative to reassure the vaccines can generate equivalent immunity against different genetic variants (especially the VOCs with increased capacity to overcome vaccination‐induced immunity) before inoculating in a large population.

This study also demonstrates the genotypes of SARS‐CoV‐2 are unique identifiers that can be used as molecular barcodes to trace the virus transmission retrospectively and to reveal its expansion prospectively at the molecular level. The SOO algorithm can match any particular SARS‐CoV‐2 viral genome to known genotypes with high accuracy based on its mutation profile. With the pandemic still ongoing, novel genotypes other than what we have characterized in this study may surface. Thus, we anticipate incorporating those newly emerging genotypes into the current algorithm may improve the performance of SOO in the future..

The United Kingdom launched a national SARS‐CoV‐2 Sequencing Consortium with £20 million funding in March 2020, aiming to investigate how coronavirus is spreading in the United Kingdom, to help guide treatments in the future, and to anticipate the impact of mitigating measures.
33
 As a result, the United Kingdom has contributed the most viral genome sequencing data to the GISAID database compared with other countries and regions, and some countries have been following the same strategy as the United Kingdom. Thanks to those SARS‐CoV‐2 sequencing initiatives, we were able to access and analyze tremendous viral genomes from all over the world in the study, which serves as a proof of concept to demonstrate the utility of large‐scale viral genome sequencing during a novel pathogen outbreak. Ramping up sampling in a real‐time manner like the UK viral genome sequencing consortium may generate high‐resolution maps of who‐infected‐whom transmission at the community level and reveal the subsequent expansion patterns which are especially crucial for the most severely stricken countries and regions to promptly develop tailored mitigation plans.
