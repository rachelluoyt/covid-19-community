B.1,"Strains sequenced in this study can be assigned to the two major clades that occurred so far during this pandemic, namely A and B.1 according to the Pangolin lineage.",PPR218521
B.1.1,"In contrast, the B.1 lineage comprises sequences associated with the large Italian outbreak in February 2020 and represents to date (date 21.07.2020), together with its sublineage B.1.1, the worldwide prevalent virus clade [19].",PPR218521
Gamma,"TTC has been identified as a hotspot for APOBEC editing among gamma herpesviruses, which are dsDNA viruses (37).",PPR162481
