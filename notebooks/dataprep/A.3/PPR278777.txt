Since the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, genetic variants have continued to emerge, complicating strategies for mitigating the disease burden of COVID-19. Positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs (n=8,735) were collected from Missouri, USA, from March-October 2020, and viral genomes (n=178) were sequenced. Hospitalization status and length of stay were extracted from medical charts of 1,335 patients and integrated with emerging genetic variants and viral shedding analyses for assessment of clinical impacts. Multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Missouri, primarily from Australia, Europe, and domestic states, were observed. Four local lineages rapidly emerged and spread across urban and rural regions in Missouri. While the majority of Missouri viruses harbored Spike-D614G mutations, a large number of unreported mutations were identified among Missouri viruses, including seven in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex and Spike protein that were positively selected. A 15.6-fold increase in viral RNA levels in swab samples occurred from March to May and remained elevated. Accounting for other comorbidities, individuals test-positive for COVID-19 with high viral loads were less likely to be hospitalized (odds ratio=0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.20, 0.77) and had shorter hospital stays (hazard ratio=0.34, p=0.003) than those with low viral loads. Overall, the first eight months of the pandemic in Missouri saw multiple locally acquired mutants emerge and dominate in urban and rural locations. Although we were unable to find associations between specific variants and greater disease severity, Missouri COVID-positive individuals that presented with increased viral shedding had less severe disease by several measures..

Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019, the virus has undergone genetic evolution. As of January 28, 2021, the United States had detected 25,301,166 cases and 423,519 deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

..

The massive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its accumulation of mutations suggests that the virus is continuing to adapt to its human host
3, 4
. Over 198 sites on the viral genome containing recurrent mutations and 80 viral lineages were identified by May
5, 6
. Sites on the SARS-CoV-2 genome are still undergoing positive selection
7, 8
. Variants of the D614G and N501Y strains (both located on the S gene) have generated global concern for increased transmissibility with little evidence of association with disease severity

..

Despite the large number of cases, the power to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States has been insufficient. As of January 16, 2021, Missouri had experienced 452,937 confirmed cases and 6,709 deaths
15
. In this study, we investigate the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants in Central and Southwest Missouri, examine viral shedding over time, and analyze the associations among emerging genetic variants, viral shedding, and disease severity..

Data from 8,735 COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal swabs from March 7-October 31, 2020 were compiled from the Paternity Testing Corporation (PTC) Laboratories in Columbia, Missouri. Samples were collected and processed using the same protocol throughout this study, and consistently tested using the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 2019 Novel Coronavirus Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel
16
. Positive tests were defined as those with a threshold cycle (Ct) <45, positive nucleocapsid (N)1 and N2, and an amplified anti-human positive control. The first positive test from each individual at CoxHealth (Springfield, Missouri) or University of Missouri Health Care (UMHC; Columbia, Missouri) was used in analyses..

Viral genomes (n=184) were sequenced from swab samples and virus isolates. Available samples (92 samples from 85 patients) collected from UMHC between March 18-May 14, 2020 were sequenced. The second batch (92 samples, 90 patients) was collected between June 28-July 12, 2020 from CoxHealth after viral loads in swabs were observed to be markedly elevated. Of these samples, 136 complete viral sequences were generated with >70% coverage (eTable 1). Viruses from remaining samples yielded partial genomes or had inadequate RNA quantity for sequencing..

Demographics, comorbidities, and hospitalization information were extracted from electronic medical records for 1,335 patients (eMethods). Ct-values were provided by PTC Laboratories. Age groups were defined in alignment with CDC reports

SARS-CoV-2 viruses were recovered in Vero E6 (CRL1586™, ATCC) or Vero (NR-10385, BEI Resources) cells a maximum of three times until cytopathic effect was observed. To determine virus replication kinetics, Vero E6 cells were infected at a starting multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, and supernatants were harvested and titrated using plaque assays (eMethods)..

SARS-CoV-2 whole genome RT-PCR amplification and nextgeneration sequencing was conducted using the Access Array (AA) microfluidic system (Fluidigm Corporation) and MiSeq system (Illumina)

Lineages were identified by PANGOLIN v2.0.8 (github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin). Unique Missouri sub-lineages were identified when they contained at least five samples with unpublished mutations, posterior probability >0.99, and sequence identity >99%..

Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze continuous variables and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. Logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of viral load (Ct≤20, high; Ct>20, low) on hospitalization or length of hospital stay, controlling for demographics and comorbidities. The effect of viral load on length of hospitalization was tested with a Cox Proportional Hazards survival analysis accounting for censoring due to death. In all analyses, significance was defined at alpha=0.05. Analyses were performed using SAS Studio v3.8 (Cary, Indiana).

The first known introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into Missouri was publicly announced on March 7th. Based on state data
30
, Missouri had an average of 153 (standard deviation [SD]=96) cases per week between March and May increasing to an average of 280 (SD=159) cases in June and climbed with sporadic spikes throughout the study period (Figure 1A). Meanwhile, the weekly case fatality rate peaked at 12% in early May, then progressively decreased and remained below 0.02% through October..

To study whether changes in viral shedding correlates with increased positivity rates, we analyzed the cycle threshold (Ct)-values derived from quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs for 8,735 patients in Central and Southwestern Missouri between March and October (Figure 1B-D, eFigure 1). Results showed that Ct-values changed over time (P<0.0001). Viral RNA loads from March through May ranged from 8.97 to 42.33 (median=24.85). The proportion of viral load cases above moderate levels (Ct≤20) began rising in May and remained elevated through October..

We conducted chart reviews for 1,335 COVID-19 individuals from March-October 2020 (Table 1). The largest age group was 18-29 years (n=562 of 1335, 42.13%). Our dataset consisted of 55.10% female (n=735) and 44.7% male (n=596). Of hospitalized patients, there were 22 males and 22 females. The population studied consisted primarily of Caucasians (n=899, 67.39%) with 15.74% Black or African American patients (n=210). Primary comorbidities were obesity (n=599, 64.90%), diabetes (n=29, 2.17%), and hypertension (n=64, 4.80%). Overall, 44 (3.30%) patients were hospitalized with an average stay of 9.90 (SD=12.67) days. Only three of the hospitalized patients were under age 30. Four patients died..

We collected nasopharyngeal swab samples from 175 patients for sequencing based on sample availability. 136 samples had adequate viral load for complete genome resolution (132 from clinical swabs, four from isolates) with 14 samples having only partial sequences and 38 samples where RNA quality was too low for sequencing..

Phylogenetic analysis showed that Missouri viruses encompassed eight major PANGOLIN lineages, each of which was associated with an independent introduction (Figure 2, eTable 2). The virus evolved after each initial introduction, and formed four unique Missouri sub-lineages, at least one (MO-B.1.1.b) of which circulated from the May through July collection periods. All sub-lineages were supported by posterior probabilities >0.99 and sequence identities >99.99% (Figure 2A). At least five lineages, including the four Missouri sub-lineages, co-circulated in Missouri during the week of July 2. All five lineages originated from lineage B.1 (containing D614G in the spike [S] protein), which has been predominant in Europe, Australia, and multiple states of United States (eFigure 2-3)..

Molecular characterization identified mutations across multiple regions of the viral genome (Figure 2B). The previously reported S-D614G and nonstructural protein [NSP]12-P314L mutations appeared in most of the Missouri samples. Compared to their precursor viruses, the Missouri viruses had 126 new mutations (eTable 3). NSP3 contained the most mutations (28 of 126 distinct mutations), followed by S (13), Nucleocapsid (N) (11), and NSP2 (11). The most common mutations include NSP12-C22F (n=18), NSP4-M366I (18), open reading frame [ORF]8-S47F (12), NSP12-A2V (11), and N-V270L (10)..

Six unique mutations (Figure 2B, eFigure 2) were detected in four sub-lineages that appear to have emerged and spread in the Southwestern region of the state. MO-B.1.1.a (n=11 sequences) had mutation NSP12-A2V; 10 of these viruses were from Springfield, Missouri collected between July 2-9; MO-B.1.1.b (n=18) contained NSP4-M366I and NSP12-C22F from patients living within 60 miles of Springfield between May 14-July 9, 2020; MO-B.1.c (n=6) with NSP3-N1178T and NSP3-A1179T includes six samples with all but one arising from Monett, an urban center in Southwestern Missouri (50 miles southwest from Springfield), between July 2-6, 2020; MO-B.1.2.d (n=6) with NSP15-P262L were from Springfield or Brighton, Missouri (20 miles north of Springfield) between July 5-7, 2020..

To explore how SARS-CoV-2 viruses were adapting in Missouri, we determined variant sites undergoing selective pressure (Figure 2B-C and eTable 4). Multiple sites along the S protein, the protein mediating host receptor binding and viral entry, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex (NSP7, NSP8, NSF12, and NSP13) had evidence of positive selection (Figure 3B). Seven of these positively selective sites were unique to Missouri isolates (i.e., D1163Y in Spike, K36Q and T145I in NSP8, and T172I, T431I, K460R, and S468L in NSP13). NSP8 is a cofactor to NSP12 (RdRp) and is necessary for RNA synthesis, NSP12 functions in viral replication and transcription, and NSP13 works with NSP12 in replication and mRNA capping

Of the selected samples, we collected multiple samples at different time points for four patients and found one case of reinfection (eFigure 4). This patient was a female in her 20s with asthma, obesity, anxiety, and depression, who reported chills, sore throat, dizziness, rhinorrhea, and fever during her initial positive COVID-19 test in March 2020. She was discharged and instructed to self-isolate. After two weeks, her symptoms had waned to encompass only cough and fatigue, and she was tested again due to her return-to-work requirements with another positive result. Interestingly, the two samples were from two distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages; the first sample belonged to PANGOLIN A.3 lineage, whereas the second belonged to PANGOLIN B.1.1 lineage, suggesting that the patient was reinfected by a different virus within a two-week period. Compared with those in A.3 lineage, the B.1.1. lineage virus had four new mutations ORF1ab-P4715L, S-D614G, N-R203L, and N-G204R..

Our observations of a temporal pattern to viral load and mutations in receptor binding domains of the S protein and RdRp complex led us to hypothesize that differences may have existed in virus replication properties. Eighteen isolates selected as representative sample strains from each viral load category and lineage were recovered from swab samples with Ct-values ranging from 9.09-37.76 (median=16.32) (Figure 3A). We determined growth kinetics for these isolates (Figure 3B) and observed a large diversity in viral growth patterns, especially during the initial 24 hours. Linear regression of viral proliferation (measured by Ct-values) at 24 hours showed that an increase of 1 cycle correlated with a decrease of 8.83 log10 (plaque forming units/mL) (Pearson correlation coefficient=-0.59, p=0.01) (Figure 3C). Taken together, the growth kinetics analyses revealed that strains with higher viral loads in clinical samples proliferated more efficiently than those with lower viral loads..

To understand potential clinical implications of the identified mutations, we analyzed associations among genetic variants in the Missouri lineages with disease severity (hospitalization and length of hospitalization) and viral loads in clinical samples. We found no significant associations between the Missouri viruses and viral loads (Chi-Square=3.35, p-value [p]=0.76) (Figure 4A) or hospitalizations (Chi-Square=0.33, p=1.00)..

We next examined potential correlations between viral load in clinical swabs and outcomes. A univariable analysis was performed to test the effect of viral load, demographics, comorbidities, and lineages on the risk for hospitalization (Figure 4D). High viral load (Adjusted log odds ratio [ALOR]=-0.34, p=0.025), age >65 years (ALOR=0.79, p<0.0001), obesity (ALOR=0.65, p=0.001), heart disease (ALOR=1.31, p=0.005), diabetes (ALOR=1.56, p<0.0001), and hypertension (ALOR=0.52, p=0.02) were independently associated with hospitalization. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, we found that patients of older age (odds ratio [OR]=1.06, p<0.0001), earlier month of diagnosis (OR=0.69, p=0.0002), higher body mass index (BMI) (OR=1.037, p=0.04), diabetes (OR=0.06, p=0.001), and low viral load (OR=0.39, p=0.03) were more likely to be hospitalized (eTable 5, Figure 4C)..

Importantly, patients with high viral loads at sampling had fewer hospitalizations (OR=0.39, p=0.01). Of hospitalized patients, those with high viral load were discharged sooner (hazard ratio = 2.9, p=0.03) (Figure 4B) compared to patients with low viral loads. There was no difference in time from symptom onset to COVID-19 test between low and high viral load groups (5.38±10.48 days and 4.25±4.43 days, respectively) or in time from symptom onset to hospital admission (10.03±10.48 days and 8.75±4.09 days, respectively)..

Studies assessing SARS-CoV-2 viral load as a marker for COVID-19 disease severity have been inconclusive. Early studies found that viral loads were correlated with age, disease stage, severity, progression, and mortality
32–37
. Most of these studies observed patients during the early stages of the pandemic and often investigated already hospitalized patients. Our study expanded these observations to thousands of patients over an eight-month period, March-October 2020, which was powered to detect that the average viral load increased over the study period. Furthermore, patients with high viral loads were less likely to become hospitalized than patients with low viral loads even after adjusting for month of diagnosis, age, obesity, and diabetes. Thus, although advances in treatment have improved patient outcomes, this was unlikely the only cause for reduced hospitalizations. Our results did suggest that heart disease and hypertension were confounding variables, not associated with hospitalization after accounting for other variables in the model. Additionally, patients with high viral loads were more likely to become discharged sooner than those with low viral loads. Because viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs typically declines after the first week of infection
38, 39
, one confounding factor may have been delayed testing, especially at the beginning of the pandemic from limited access to testing. We did not, however, find differences in time from symptom onset to initial COVID-19 swab between the high and low viral load groups among hospitalized patients..

The clinical findings and demographics from our study are reflective of national data, lending confidence towards the generalizability of our patient population
1
. Exceptions include the distribution of cases within the 18-29-year age category where we noted 50% higher proportional incidence than CDC data; correspondingly, our >50 age categories were slightly less than national data. This reflects the catchment area of our study which includes the University of Missouri with a high proportion of college-aged students. Additionally, our population had slightly lower Asian, higher Black or African American and White, and over 50% lower Hispanic or Latino individuals than national data, reflecting the overall racial and ethnic distribution in Missouri. We also found that other risk factors for hospitalization included older age, elevated BMI, and diabetes mellitus, consistent with published studies

Genomic and phylogenetic evidence revealed multiple viral introductions into and across the state and numerous mutations during the first four months of the pandemic. We identified novel Missouri variants and lineages among both urban and rural communities. Four unique, well-supported sub-lineages were identified in Missouri, of which MO-B.1.1.b appeared to have persisted for at least two months. All four lineages emerged during the July sampling period in Southwestern Missouri and appeared more likely to arise in the urban Springfield area, then spread to neighboring urban and rural communities. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether any of these remained locally prominent..

Over the past year, variants containing the D614G and N501Y mutations dominated global outbreaks. D614G (B.1 lineage), first identified in January 2020, became predominant worldwide by June 2020
42
. The N501Y strain (B.1.1.7 lineage) was detected first in the United Kingdom
10
 and then appeared in other countries
9
 including the United States
11
. D614G mutations enhanced viral replication and transmission but not pathogenesis in laboratory settings
43, 44
. However, disease transmission and severity of these novel variants in humans remain unclear
45
. Prior studies suggested that D614G is associated with higher viral load
14, 46
, but the mutation was already predominant in both high and low viral load Missouri strains. In our findings, viral load increased over time (Figure 1). We explored whether a particular genetic variant was associated with the increased viral loads and were unable to find a clear association. Thus, we speculate that throughout the pandemic, all emerging variants of the virus were adapting to the human populations with greater viral replication efficiency. Of interest, multiple sites, especially at the Spike protein and RdRp complex, across multiple Missouri sub-lineages were under positive selection (Figure 3). Selection at the RdRp complex may affect viral replication and transcription
47, 48
, while selection at the S protein may affect host receptor binding and viral entry
47
. Further examination of mutations from this and other studies will elucidate the phenotypic effects of these mutations..

Increasing case studies of reinfection and studies involving waning neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers raise concerns for herd immunity and long-lasting efficacy of vaccines
49–51
. CDC criteria for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection include persons with paired respiratory specimens at least 90 days apart and symptomatic persons 45-89 days after initial illness with respective respiratory specimens showing differing lineages
52
. Recent studies show Nab titers to SARS-CoV-2 decline as early as 23 days following initial infection
53
. In this study, a young female patient was identified with two genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 strains within two weeks, indicating that re-infection can occur within a much shorter period than expected..

There are several limitations to this study. Analyses with viral loads are limited by variability in nasopharyngeal swabbing techniques, which may cause inconsistencies in Ct-values, although the same sampling and processing protocol was used throughout this study. Additionally, during the initial phases of the pandemic, testing was generally limited to patients with more severe symptoms, potentially skewing viral load findings. Despite these limitations, we analyzed a large, representative sample, and adjusted for these confounders..

In summary, multiple novel lineages were identified, and locally acquired mutations, present at both the urban and rural levels, remained predominant in the community. Although we were unable to find associations between specific variants and greater disease severity, Missouri COVID-positive individuals that presented with increased viral shedding had less severe disease by several measures. Continued monitoring of the impacts of these novel variants, particularly of those in the regions of vaccine targets, will be essential to the management of this pandemic..
