COVID-19 vaccines are highly efficacious, but SARS-CoV-2 infections post-vaccination occur. We characterized COVID-19 cases among fully vaccinated persons with an outcome of death..

We analyzed COVID-19 cases voluntarily reported to CDC by US health departments during January 1, 2021–April 30, 2021. We included cases among U.S. residents with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test ≥14 days after completion of an authorized primary vaccine series and who had a known outcome (alive or death) as of May 31, 2021. When available, specimens were sequenced for viral lineage and death certificates were reviewed for cause(s) of death..

Of 8,084 reported COVID-19 cases among fully vaccinated persons during the surveillance period, 245 (3.0%) died. Compared with patients who remained alive, those who died were older (median age 82 years vs. 57 years, P <0.01), more likely to reside in a long-term care facility (51% vs. 18%, P <0.01), and more likely to have at least one underlying health condition associated with risk for severe disease (64% vs. 24%, P <0.01). Among 245 deaths, 191 (78%) were classified as COVID-19-related. Of 106 deaths with available death certificates, COVID-19 was listed on 81 (77%). There were no differences in the type of vaccine administered or the most common viral lineage (B.1.1.7)..

COVID-19 deaths are rare in fully vaccinated persons, occurring most commonly in those with risk factors for severe disease, including older age and underlying health conditions. All eligible persons should be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and follow other prevention measures to mitigate exposure risk..
