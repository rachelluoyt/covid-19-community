The rapid and relentless emergence of novel highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, possibly decreasing vaccine efficacy, currently represents a formidable medical and societal challenge. These variants frequently hold mutations on the Spike protein’s Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD), which, binding to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, mediates viral entry into the host cells..

Here, all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations and Dynamical Network Theory of the wild-type and mutant RBD/ACE2 adducts disclose that while the N501Y mutation (UK variant) enhances the Spike’s binding affinity towards ACE2, the N501Y, E484K and K417N mutations (South African variant) aptly adapt to increase SARS-CoV-2 propagation via a two-pronged strategy: (i) effectively grasping ACE2 through an allosteric signaling between pivotal RBD structural elements; and (ii) impairing the binding of antibodies elicited by infected/vaccinated patients. This information, unlocking the molecular terms and evolutionary strategies underlying the increased virulence of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, set the basis for developing the next-generation anti-COVID-19 therapeutics..

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), has infected as of April 30rd about 150 million patients, causing over 3 million deaths worldwide. Owing to an unprecedentedly intense and relentless scientific effort, a variety of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies are becoming available for COVID-19 prophylaxis and therapeutic treatment.

Alike other β-coronavirus (β-CoVs) the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the homotrimeric viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates the molecular recognition and the binding to the human cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
4–5
 thus triggering SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. As such, the S-protein has been object of burgeoning research interest, becoming the prominent target for antibodies development. This prompted an exhaustive experimental
6–8
 and computational
9–12
 assessment of the molecular interactions between the S-protein and ACE2..

The worldwide continuous and uncontrolled transmission of SARS-CoV-2 set the condition for its rapid evolution into more infectious variants. As an example, one of the first S-protein mutation, D614G, characterized by an enhanced transmissibility, has rapidly become dominant.
13
 As well, other alarming strains have emerged: in United Kingdom (lineage B.1.1.7),
14
 South Africa (lineage B.1.351)
15
 and Brazil (lineage P.1),
16
 hereafter referred as the UK, SA and BR variants, respectively. Ultimately, a new dire Indian variant (lineage B.1.617) come to the fore. These lineages are object of raising concerns owing to their increased transmissibility and/or their potential ability to escape from infection/vaccines-induced immunity..

As concerns the most prominent nonsynonymous mutations placed in the S-protein’s RBD, most SARS-CoV-2 variants share the N501Y substitution (Figure 1), most likely implicated into an enhanced binding affinity towards ACE2,
17–19
 although preliminary reports indicates that this variant retains vaccine efficacy.
20
 In addition to N501Y, the SA variant also exhibits the E484K and K417N RBD mutations. E484, the most frequently mutated residue in COVID-19 patients, becomes E484K in the SA and BR and E484Q in the Indian strains. As well, mutation of K417, either to N or a T, is shared by the SA and BR variants, respectively. These mutations have been linked to viral escape from mAbs developed by vaccinated/infected patients.

Aiming to dissect at atomic-level the role of RDB mutations on the recognition of ACE2, we performed cumulative 15 μs all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of S-protein RBD/ACE2 complexes considering the RBD’s mutations present in the SA variant either concurrently or singularly..

Namely, we first built the adduct between ACE2 and RBD carrying the N501Y, E484K and K417N substitutions of the SA lineage (hereafter referred as SARBD/ACE2). Next, to inspect the role of each mutation, we built three distinct RBD/ACE2 models carrying N501Y (N501YRBD/ACE2 or UKRBD/ACE2), E484K (E484KRBD/ACE2) and K417N (K417NRBD/ACE2), ultimately comparing them with the WT RBD/ACE2 adduct (hereafter named RDB/ACE2). As a result, all the systems retain stable interactions at the RBD/ACE2 interface during 2.5 μs-long MD simulations (Figure S1). Most of the RBD residues binding to ACE2 lie within the receptor-binding motif (RBM), which is composed by two small β-strands and 4 flexible loops. In a previous study, we pinpointed the rigidity of RBD Loop3 (L3, composed by Thr470-Pro491) as the main factor underlying the larger binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 towards ACE2,
9
 with respect to the closely-related SARS-CoV. In the current set of MD simulations all the investigated systems evidence an akin RBMs flexibility, with small differences being restricted to Loop1 and 4 (L1/4, Figure S2), where N501Y is placed (Figure 1)..

Although not engaging direct interactions with ACE2, in the WT adduct N501@RBD intramolecularly H-bonds to Gln498, mediating the formation of a persistent H-bond network between the latter residue and Asp38@ACE2 (Figure 1), thus being the most dynamically correlated residue of the whole RBM (Figure S3).
9,23
 Nonetheless, in the SARBD/ACE2 and N501YRBD/ACE2 complexes N501Y further reinforces its prominent role in hijacking ACE2 by establishing π-stacking interactions with Tyr41@ACE2 (Figures 1, S4 and Table S1) and directly H-bonding to Asp38@ACE2, consistently with the N501YS-protein/ACE2 cryo-EM structure.
24
 Although the total binding free energies (ΔGb) of the distinct RBD/ACE2 adducts, calculated with the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) method,
25
 do not allow to discriminate the subtle differences between WT and mutant RDB/ACE2 adducts, the dissection of the per-residue amino acids ΔGb contributions appears to be in agreement with experimental deep mutational scanning analyses.
18
 Indeed, the ΔGb of Y501 increases with respect to its WT counterpart (−7.9 and −7.2 kcal/mol, in the N501YRBD/ACE2 and SARBD/ACE2 models, respectively) (Figure 1), while inducing a ΔGb loss of nearby RBD residues (i.e. Glu498). The overall energetic gain of L1/4 region appears to be slightly favorable in N501YRBD/ACE2 and SARBD/ACE2, lowering the ΔGb of 11-12 kcal/mol (Figure S4). As such, N501Y, present in the highly infective UK and SA variants, increases the RBD binding affinity for ACE2 (Figures 1, S4), consistently with experimental evidence.
18–19
 This comes along a more effective grasping and bending of the ACE2’s α1-helix in both N501YRBD/ACE2 and SARBD/ACE2 models as compared to RBD/ACE2 (Figure 2)..

We also inspected the role of E484K mutation common to the SA and BR variants. Consistently with deep mutational scanning,
18
 our MD simulations reveal that E484K only slightly increases the per-residue ΔGb by 0.4±0.2 and 0.5±0.5 kcal/mol in SARBD/ACE2 and E484KRBD/ACE2, respectively. Since E484K does not directly H-bonds to ACE2, the ΔGb increase must owe to the electrostatic interactions between K484 and the nearby ACE2’s negatively charged (Asp and Glu) residues (Figure S5). Remarkably, K484 only modestly increases α1@ACE2 bending, as compared to the WT model (Figure 2C)..

We finally assessed the role of K417,
15
 whose salt-bridge with Asp30@ACE2, present in half of the RBD/ACE2 MD trajectory, is lost upon K417N mutation (Figure S6 and Table S1). Consistently with experimental findings K417N triggers a small destabilization (ΔGb decrease by 0.9±0.5 kcal/mol) of K417NRBD/ACE2 and SARBD/ACE2 as compared to RBD/ACE2,
18
 and does not increase the α1-helix@ACE2 bending (Figure 2). Hence, the way K417N contributes to enhance the ACE2 sequestration remains elusive..

Due to the strategic location of K417, halfway of L1/4 and L3 in the RBM, tweezing the α1-helix@ACE2, we computed the cross-correlation matrices based on the Pearson’s correlation coefficient and the per-residue sum of the Cross-Correlation coefficient (CCc) for the residues at the RBM/ACE2 interface (Figure S3).
26–27
 Stunningly,SARBD/ACE2 and K417RBD/ACE2 exhibit the largest CCcs all over the RBM, with the difference of SARBD/ACE2 being more marked at the L1/4 and L3 regions..

Aiming to assess whether the mutations could interfere with the RBD’s slow motions, we performed principal component (PC) analysis of WT and mutant RBD models to gather their most relevant motions (essential dynamics). As a result, PC1 and 2 of WT or all mutant RBD systems reveal an opening/closing motions of L1/4 and L3 regions, implicated in grasping α1-helix@ACE2 (Figure S7). Since an allosteric communication among SARS-CoV-2 mutations has been recently speculated,
28–30
 we then applied dynamical NetWork theory Analysis (NWA) to decrypt the information-exchange pathways underlying the observed RBD functional dynamics and to decode whether RBD mutants can enhance the allosteric cross-talk between critical RDB’s structural elements.
26,31
 In NWA, the protein is represented as a correlation-based weighted network. The nodes (the residues’ center of mass) are connected by edges whose numerical value (weight) indicates the correlation-strength between residues pairs (i.e. small/large weights reflect highly/poorly correlated and anticorrelated motions). By computing cross-correlations between residues along an MD trajectory, NWA finds the optimal and suboptimal signaling-paths between two user-selected source (484@L3) and sink (501@L4) residues. The outcoming path-lengths are thus inversely proportional to the signaling-strength and to the amount of correlation existing among their tracing nodes.
31

.

By performing NWA on the RBD alone we observed several cross-communication paths crossing the RBM, which in RBD/ACE2 minorly involve even K417 (Figure 3B). Remarkably, in N501Y(UK)RBD and SARBD these paths are shorter (the residues are more correlated) suggesting a stronger signaling between the two RBM extremities, which may result in a more effective opening/closing of the L1/4 and L3..

Stunningly, in all RBD/ACE2 models allosteric signaling within RBM occurs along the α1-helix@ACE2 (Figures 3A,C) and the path-lengths distribution of both SARBD/ACE2 and K417NRBD/ACE2 (Figure 3E) is shifted towards lower values, suggesting that the motions of RBM’s residues are more tightly correlated, thus triggering a more effective ACE2 hijacking. The similar distribution observed for SARBD/ACE2 and K417NRBD/ACE2 suggests that K417N is primarily liable for the enhanced cross-talk between critical RBD recognition loops. Conversely, the N501Y and E484K mutations does not affect and even contrast this cross-talk, respectively (Figure 3E)..

To identify the residues critically involved in the signaling-pathways we computed the node degeneracy (i.e. number of times a node is present in the calculated paths). In the presence of the RBD mutations a significant variation in degeneracy is observed for those residues engaging H-bond or hydrophobic interactions at the RBD/ACE2 interface, among which Asp38@ACE2, Asp355@ACE2, and Thr500@RBD (Figure S8 and Table S3). To further dissect the source of the increased cross-talk in the mutant RBD/ACE2 complexes we inspected whether RBD mutations alter the intra-RBD H-bonds networks at RBD/ACE2 interface. Interestingly, the main differences among the investigated systems are localized on L3-4, nearby the mutation sites (Table S4). In particular, a decrease of the intramolecular H-bond persistence of Asn487, which strongly H-bonds ACE2 (Table S1), results into a higher node-degeneracy in the signaling-route (Table S3)..

Complementarily, structural X-ray and Cryo-EM studies elucidated that K417 and E484 RBD residues establish H-bonds with distinct mAbs isolated from COVID-19 patients’ sera. Hence, K417N and E484K substitutions alter the electrostatic complementarity between the RBD and class 1 and 2 mAbs, respectively (Figures 4 and Table S5),
32–37
 impairing mAbs binding and contributing to viral escape from vaccine/disease-induced immunity.

.

In summary, aiming to dissecting the molecular basis for the higher infectivity and transmissibility of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, we have assessed the impact of the SA set of mutations, localized in the RBD, even inspecting the role of each single mutant. As a result, we disclose that while N501Y (hallmark of the UK variant) enhances the binding affinity towards ACE2 and α1-helix@ACE2 bending, the SA strain exploits a two-pronged strategy to more effectively infect the host cells by (i) increasing the allosteric signaling among the pivotal RBM extremes, which acting as a tweezer, more effectively grasp/bend the α1-helix@ACE2, (ii) destabilizing/impairing the interactions with class 1 and 2 mAbs (K417N and E484K, respectively) extracted from COVID-19 patients’ sera (Figure 4 and Table S5). Stunningly, the main actor in modulating the allosteric cross-talk among the RBD mutants appears to be K417N, whose role has remained so far elusive. In this scenario, it is tempting to argue that the BR variant, differing from the SA one only by the K417T@RBD substitution, may exploit the same strategy to foster viral propagation. Our outcomes contribute to decrypt at atomic-level the evolutionary strategies underlying the increased SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and spreading of emerging variants, setting a conceptual basis to devise the next-generation therapeutic strategies against current and future viral strains..
