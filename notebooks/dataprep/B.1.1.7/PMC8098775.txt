In this study, we used an integrative computational approach to examine molecular
mechanisms and determine functional signatures underlying the role of functional
residues in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are targeted by novel mutational variants
and antibody-escaping mutations. Atomistic simulations and functional dynamics analysis
are combined with alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity profiling of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with the ACE2 host receptor and the REGN-COV2
antibody cocktail(REG10987+REG10933). Using alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity
analysis, we have shown that K417, E484, and N501 residues correspond to key interacting
centers with a significant degree of structural and energetic plasticity that allow
mutants in these positions to afford the improved binding affinity with ACE2. Through
perturbation-based network modeling and community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein complexes with ACE2, we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417, and N501 residues
serve as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major intermolecular
communities that mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The results provide
support to a model according to which mutational variants and antibody-escaping
mutations constrained by the requirements for host receptor binding and preservation of
stability may preferentially select structurally plastic and energetically adaptable
allosteric centers to differentially modulate collective motions and allosteric
interactions in the complexes with the ACE2 enzyme and REGN-COV2 antibody combination.
This study suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may function as a versatile and
functionally adaptable allosteric machine that exploits the plasticity of allosteric
regulatory centers to fine-tune response to antibody binding without compromising the
activity of the spike protein..

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic associated with the severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS)1−5 has been at the focal point
of biomedical research. SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted when the viral spike (S)
glycoprotein binds to the host cell receptor, leading to the entry of S protein into host
cells and membrane fusion.6−8 The full-length SARS-CoV-2
S protein consists of two main domains, amino (N)-terminal S1 subunit and carboxyl
(C)-terminal S2 subunit. The subunit S1 is involved in the interactions with the host
receptor and includes an N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and two
structurally conserved subdomains (SD1 and SD2). Structural and biochemical studies have
shown that the mechanism of virus infection may involve spontaneous conformational
transformations of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein between a spectrum of closed and
receptor-accessible open forms, where RBD continuously switches between “down”
and “up” positions where the latter can promote binding with the host receptor
ACE2.9−11 The crystal structures of
the S-RBD in the complexes with human ACE2 enzyme revealed structurally conserved binding
mode shared by the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins in which an extensive interaction
network is formed by the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the RBD
region.12−16 These studies
established that binding of the SARS-CoV-RBD to the ACE2 receptor can be a critical initial
step for virus entry into target cells. The rapidly growing body of cryo-EM structures of
the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins detailed distinct conformational arrangements of S protein trimers
in the prefusion form that are manifested by a dynamic equilibrium between the closed
(“RBD-down”) and the receptor-accessible open (“RBD-up”) form
required for the S protein fusion to the viral membrane.17−34 The
cryo-EM characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer demonstrated that S protein may populate
a spectrum of closed states by fluctuating between structurally rigid locked-closed form and
more dynamic, closed states preceding a transition to the fully open S conformation.26 Conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoprotein in complex
with receptor ACE2 suggesting considerable conformational heterogeneity of ACE2-RBD and
continuous swing motions of ACE2-RBD in the context of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer. According to
these experiments, the associated ACE2-RBD is relatively dynamic, showing three major
conformational states with different angle of ACE2-RBD to the surface of the S
trimer.33.

Cryo-EM structural studies also mapped a mechanism of conformational events associated with
ACE2 binding, showing that the compact closed form of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein becomes
weakened after furin cleavage between the S1 and S2 domains, leading to the increased
population of partially open states and followed by ACE2 recognition that can accelerate the
transformation to a fully open and ACE2-bound form priming the protein for fusion
activation.34 These studies confirmed a general mechanism of population
shifts between different functional states of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimers, suggesting that RBD
epitopes can become stochastically exposed to the interactions with the host receptor
ACE2..

The biochemical and functional studies using protein engineering and deep mutagenesis have
quantified binding mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 interactions with the host
receptor.35,36 Deep
mutational scanning of SARS-CoV-2 RBD revealed constraints on folding and ACE2 binding
showing that many mutations of the RBD residues can be well tolerated with respect to both
folding and binding. A surprisingly large number of amino acid modifications could even
improve ACE2 binding, including important binding interface positions that enhance RBD
expression (V367F and G502D) or enhance ACE2 affinity (N501F, N501T, and Q498Y).35 This comprehensive mutational scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues
suggested the evolutionary potential for compensation of deleterious mutations in the ACE2
interface reminiscent of multistep escape pathways and highlighted the energetic plasticity
of the SARS-CoV-2 interaction networks in which mutations may enhance binding affinity, thus
providing a roadmap for quantifying map immune-escape mutations. Using deep mutagenesis, it
was also demonstrated that human ACE2 is only suboptimal for binding of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
as ACE2 variants near the interface can result in improved binding and simultaneously
enhance folding stability.36 Mutational landscape analysis showed a
significant number of ACE2 mutations at the interface that enhance RBD binding, and the
molecular basis for affinity enhancement can be rationalized from the structural
analysis.36 Functional studies characterized the key amino acid
residues of the RBD for binding with human ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies, revealing two
groups of amino acid residues to modulate binding, where the SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations
N439/R426, L452/K439, T470/N457, E484/P470, Q498/Y484, and N501/T487 can result in the
enhanced binding affinity for ACE2.37 Additionally, A475 and F486 in the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD were identified as the key residues for the recognition of both their common
functional receptor ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies, suggesting structural and energetic
plasticity of the RBM residues involved in ACE2 recognition may induce mutational escape
from the neutralizing antibodies targeting the RBD regions..

The rapidly growing structural studies of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Abs) have delineated
molecular mechanisms underlying binding competition with the ACE2 host receptor, showing
that combinations of Abs can provide broad and efficient cross-neutralization effects
through synergistic targeting of conserved and variable SARS-CoV-2 RBD
epitope.38−49
Structural studies confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein can feature distinct antigenic
sites, and some specific Abs may allosterically inhibit the ACE2 receptor binding without
directly interfering with ACE2 recognition.44 The SARS-CoV-2 Abs are
divided into several main classes, of which class 1 and class 2 antibodies target epitopes
that overlap with the ACE2 binding site.50,51 The structural studies revealed binding epitopes and
binding mechanisms for a number of newly reported SARS-CoV-2 Abs targeting RBD regions and
competing with ACE2 include B38 and H14 Abs,52 P2B-2F6,53 CA1 and CB6,54 CC12.1 and CC12.3,55
C105,56 and BD-23 Ab.57 The crystal structure of a
neutralizing Ab CR3022 in the complex with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD revealed binding to a highly
conserved epitope that is located away from the ACE2-binding site but could only be accessed
when two RBDs adopt the “up” conformation.42 Subsequent
structural and surface plasmon resonance studies confirmed that CR3022 binds the RBD of
SARS-CoV-2, displaying strong neutralization by allosterically perturbing the interactions
between the RBD regions and ACE2 receptor.43 The crystal structure of an
RBD-EY6A Fab complex identified the highly conserved epitope located away from the ACE2
binding site, showing that EY6A can compete with CR3022 by targeting residues that are
important for stabilizing the prefusion S conformation.58.

The B.1.1.7 variant of the SARS-CoV-2, a descendant of the D614G lineage, has originated in
the UK and spread to 62 countries showing the increased transmissibility. Eight of the 17
mutations observed in this variant are accumulated in the S protein, featuring most
prominently N501Y mutation that can increase binding affinity with ACE2 while eliciting
immune escape and reduced neutralization of RBD-targeting Abs.59−61 A new SARS-CoV-2 lineage (501Y.V2) first detected in South Africa is
characterized by 21 mutations with 8 lineage-defining mutations in the S protein, including
three at important RBD residues (K417N, E484K, and N501Y) that have functional significance
and often induce significant immune escape.62,63 Finally, the recently discovered new lineage, named P.1
(descendent of B.1.1.28), was observed in December in Brazil and contains a constellation of
lineage defining mutations, including several mutations of known biological importance such
as E484K, K417T, and N501Y mutations.64,65.

Functional mapping of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD that escape antibody binding using
deep mutational scanning showed that the escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the
RBD and have large effects on antibody escape while a negligible negative impact on ACE2
binding and RBD folding.66 This illuminating study demonstrated that
escape sites from antibodies can be constrained with respect to their effects on expression
of properly folded RBD and ACE2 binding, suggesting that escape-resistant antibody cocktails
can compete for binding to the same RBD region but have different escape mutations, which
limit the virus ability to acquire novel sites of immune escape in the RBD without
compromising its binding to ACE2.66 Comprehensive mapping of mutations in
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that affect recognition by polyclonal human serum antibodies revealed
that mutations in E484 site tend to have the largest effect on antibody binding to the
RBD,67 and various functional neutralization assay experiments
indicated that E484 modifications can reduce the neutralization potency by some antibodies
by >10-fold.67−69 These studies also
indicated that K417N and N501Y mutants can escape neutralization by some monoclonal
antibodies but typically only modestly affected binding.67,70 At the same time, mutations in the epitope
centered around E484 position (G485, F486, F490) or in the 443–455 loop (K444, V445,
L455, F456 sites) strongly affected neutralization for several Abs.67−71 Functional mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues that
affect the binding of the REGN-COV2 cocktail showed that REGN10933 and REGN10987 are escaped
by different mutations as mutation at F486 escaped neutralization only by REGN10933, whereas
mutations at K444 escaped neutralization only by REGN10987, while E406W escaped both
individual REGN-COV2 antibodies.70 This study confirmed that escape
mutations at Q493, Q498, and N501 sites may enhance binding affinity with ACE2 and that
escape mutations can also emerge in positions distant from the immediate proximity of the
binding epitope, highlighting structural and energetic plasticity of the RBD regions and
potential allosteric-based mechanism of immune escape.70 The REGN-COV2
cocktail (REG10987+REG10933) demonstrated significant potential in preventing mutational
escape,72 several other antibody cocktails such as
COV2–2130+COV2–2196,73 BD-368–2+BD-629,74 and B38+H452 displayed promising neutralization
activities. Analysis of the molecular determinants and mechanisms of mutational escape
showed that SARS-CoV-2 virus rapidly escapes from individual antibodies but does not easily
escape from the cocktail due to stronger evolutionary constraints on RBD-ACE2 interaction
and RBD protein folding.75 According to this study, the key RBD positions
critical for the escape of antibody combinations include K444, which is an important epitope
residue for CoV2–06, P2B-2F6, S309 and REG10987 Abs, as well as E484/F486 sites that
are central for binding of CoV2–14 and REG10933. Functional analysis validated that
mutations of these residues are responsible for viral escape from the individual Abs and, in
combination with other currently circulating variants (N501Y, K417N, E484K), may induce the
reduced neutralization by the antibody cocktails.75 The SARS-CoV-2
501Y.V2 lineage that includes one cluster in NTD with four substitutions and a deletion
(L18F, D80A, D215G, Δ242–244, and R246I), and another cluster of three
substitutions in RBD (K417N, E484K, and N501Y) can confer neutralization escape from
SARS-CoV-2 directed monoclonal antibodies and significantly increased neutralization
resistance from individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus.76
Moreover, three class 1 antibodies (CA1, CB6, and CC12.1) that target the ACE2-binding RBM
region showed a complete lack of binding for the 501Y.V2 variant, suggesting that mutations
in the RBD and NTD clusters may amplify the mutational escape from RBD-targeted Abs..

Structural and functional studies showed that the activity of mRNA vaccine-elicited
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variant encoding E484K or N501Y or the
K417N/E484K/N501Y combination can be reduced by a small but significant margin, suggesting
that these mutations in individuals with compromised immunity may erode the effectiveness of
vaccine-elicited immunity.77 Importantly, it was also shown that
neutralization by 14 of the 17 most potent tested mAbs can be partly reduced or even
abolished by either K417N, or E484K, or N501Y mutations. Another latest study reported the
preserved neutralization of N501Y, Δ69/70 + N501Y + D614G and E484K + N501Y + D614G
viruses by BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited human sera.77 Consistent with other
studies, it was shown that the neutralization against the virus with three mutations from
the SA variant (E484K + N501Y + D614G) was slightly lower than the neutralization against
the N501Y virus and the virus with three UK mutations (Δ69/70 + N501Y + D614G), but
these differences were relatively small.78 SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses
bearing either the reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 40
participants who were vaccinated with the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2 showed largely
preserved neutralization, indicating that the B.1.1.7 lineage will not escape
BNT162b2-mediated protection.79 The recent data demonstrate reduced but
still significant neutralization against the full B.1.351 variant following mRNA-1273
vaccination.80 New SARS-CoV-2 variants that resist neutralizing
antibodies are now emerging in low frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations. In
particular, recent reports presented evidence of circulating SARS-CoV-2 spike N439 K
variants evading antibody-mediated immunity, particularly N439 K mutation that confers
resistance against several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and reduces the activity of
mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies.81 Computational modeling and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations have been instrumental in predicting conformational and energetic
determinants of SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms and the binding affinity and selectivity with the host
receptor ACE2.82−93
Molecular mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 binding with ACE2 enzyme were analyzed in our recent
study using coevolution and conformational dynamics.94 Using protein
contact networks and perturbation response scanning based on elastic network models, we
recently discovered the existence of allosteric sites on the SARS-CoV- 2 spike
protein.95 By using molecular simulations and network modeling, we
recently presented the first evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can function as an
allosteric regulatory engine that fluctuates between dynamically distinct functional
states.96 Coarse-grained normal-mode analyses combined with Markov
model and computation of transition probabilities characterized the dynamics of the S
protein and the effects of mutational variants D614G and N501Y on protein dynamics and
energetics.97 Using time-independent component analysis (tICA) and
protein networks, another computational study identified the hotspot residues that may
exhibit long-distance coupling with the RBD opening, showing that some mutations may
allosterically affect the stability of the RBD regions.98 Molecular
simulations reveal that N501Y mutation increases ACE2 binding affinity and may impact the
collective dynamics of the ACE2-RBD complex while mutations K417N and E484K reduce the
ACE2-binding affinity by abolishing the interfacial salt bridges.99 The
growing body of computational modeling studies investigating dynamics and molecular
mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 mutational variants produced inconsistent results that propose
different mechanisms. The development of a more unified view and a working theoretical model
that can explain the diverse experimental observations is an important area of current
efforts in the field..

In this study, we used an integrative computational approach to examine molecular
mechanisms underlying the functional role of K417, N439, E484, and N501 positions targeted
by novel mutational variants in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. We combined coarse-grained (CG)
simulations and atomistic reconstruction of dynamics trajectories with dynamic fluctuation
communication analysis, mutational sensitivity analysis, and network community modeling to
examine complexes of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and dissociated S1 domain of the S protein formed
with the ACE2 host receptor. Using distance fluctuations communication analysis and
functional dynamics analysis, we determine and compare the distribution of regulatory
centers in the RBD complexes with ACE2 and REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail
(REG10987+REG10933)..

Using alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity analysis, we show that K417, E484, and
N501 residues correspond to key interacting centers with a significant degree of structural
and energetic plasticity that allow mutants in these positions to afford the improved
binding affinity with ACE2. Through perturbation-based network modeling and community
analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes with ACE2, we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417,
and N501 residues serve as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major
intermolecular communities that mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The
results of the comparative network analysis with antibody complexes show that mutations in
these positions can alter structural arrangements with antibodies and compromise their
neutralization effects. These results suggest that antibody-escaping mutations target
allosteric mediating hotspots with sufficient plasticity and adaptability to modulate and
improve binding and allosteric signaling functions with the host receptor activity while
reducing the efficiency of antibody recognition and long-range communications. This analysis
suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein may function as a versatile and functionally
adaptable allosteric machine that exploits the plasticity of allosteric regulatory centers
to generate escape mutants that fine-tune response to antibody binding without compromising
the activity of the spike protein..

Coarse-grained (CG) models are computationally effective approaches for simulations of
large systems over long time scales. In this study, CG-CABS model100−104 was used for simulations of the crystal
structures of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with ACE2 (PDB id 6M0J)15 and complexes formed by the
dissociated S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike bound to ACE2 (PDB id 7A91, 7A92)34 (Figure 1A–C). We also simulated the cryo-EM
structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with the Fab fragments of two neutralizing
antibodies, REGN10933 and REGN10987 (PDB id 6XDG)105 (Figure 1D–F). In this high-resolution model, the amino acid residues are
represented by Cα, Cβ, the center of mass of side chains and another
pseudoatom placed in the center of the Cα-Cα pseudobond. In this model, the
amino acid residues are represented by Cα, Cβ, the center of mass of side
chains and the center of the Cα-Cα pseudobond. The CABS-flex approach
implemented as a Python 2.7 object-oriented standalone package was used in this study to
integrate a high-resolution coarse-grained model with robust and efficient conformational
sampling proven to accurately recapitulate all-atom MD simulation trajectories of proteins
on a long time scale.104 Conformational sampling in the CABS-flex
approach is conducted with the aid of Monte Carlo replica-exchange dynamics and involves
local moves of individual amino acids in the protein structure and global moves of small
fragments.100−102.

epitope on RBD is highlighted in cyan patches on the surface. The positions of E406,
K417, E484, F486, N501 are shown as black surface patches on the RBD. (F) A close-up

black surface patches on the RBD..

The default settings were applied in which soft native-like restraints are imposed only
on pairs of residues fulfilling the following conditions: the distance between their
Cα atoms was smaller than 8 Å, and both residues
belong to the same secondary structure elements. A total of 1,000 independent CG-CABS
simulations were performed for each of the studied systems. In each simulation, the total
number of cycles was set to 10,000, and the number of cycles between trajectory frames was
100. MODELER-based reconstruction of simulation trajectories to the all-atom
representation provided by the CABS-flex package was employed to produce atomistic models
of the equilibrium ensembles for studied systems..

All structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank.106,107 During the structure preparation
stage, protein residues in the crystal structures were inspected for missing residues and
protons. Hydrogen atoms and missing residues were initially added and assigned according
to the WHATIF program web interface.108,109 The structures were further preprocessed through the
Protein Preparation Wizard (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY) and included the check
of bond order, assignment and adjustment of ionization states, formation of disulfide
bonds, removal of crystallographic water molecules and cofactors, capping of the termini,
assignment of partial charges, and addition of possible missing atoms and side chains that
were not assigned in the initial processing with the WHATIF program. The missing loops in
the studied crystal structures of the dissociated S1 domain complexes with ACE2 (residues
556–573, 618–632) were reconstructed and optimized using template-based loop
prediction approaches ModLoop,110 ArchPRED server111
and further confirmed by FALC (Fragment Assembly and Loop Closure) program.112 The side-chain rotamers were refined and optimized by SCWRL4 tool.113 The shielding of the receptor binding sites by glycans is an important
common feature of viral glycoproteins, and glycosylation on SARS-CoV proteins can
camouflage immunogenic protein epitopes.114,115 The atomistic structures from simulation trajectories of
the dissociated S1 domain complex with ACE2 (PDB id 7A92) were elaborated by adding N-acetyl glycosamine (NAG)
glycan residues and optimized. The glycosylated microenvironment for atomistic models of
the simulation trajectories was mimicked by using the structurally resolved glycan
conformations for most occupied N-glycans as determined in the cryo-EM structures of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike S trimer in the closed state (K986P/V987P,) (PDB id 6VXX) and open state (PDB id 6VYB)..

We performed principal component analysis (PCA) of reconstructed trajectories derived
from CABS-CG simulations using the CARMA package116 and also determined
the essential slow mode profiles using elastic network models (ENM) analysis.117 Two elastic network models: Gaussian network model
(GNM)117,118 and
Anisotropic network model (ANM) approaches119 were used to compute the
amplitudes of isotropic thermal motions and directionality of anisotropic motions. The
functional dynamics analysis was conducted using the GNM in which protein structure is
reduced to a network of N residue nodes identified by
Cα atoms and the fluctuations of each node are assumed
to be isotropic and Gaussian. Conformational mobility profiles in the essential space of
low frequency modes were obtained using ANM server119 and DynOmics
server.120.

We have computed the relative solvent accessibility parameter (RSA) that is defined as
the ratio of the absolute solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of that residue observed
in a given structure and the maximum attainable value of the solvent-exposed surface area
for this residue.121 According to this model, residues are considered
to be solvent-exposed if the ratio value exceeds 50% and to be buried if the ratio is less
than 20%. Analytical SASA is estimated computationally using analytical equations and
their first and second derivatives and was computed using web server GetArea.121.

To compute protein stability and binding free energy changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
structures upon complex formation with ACE2 receptor and REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail, we
conducted a systematic alanine scanning of protein residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1
domain. In addition, a complete mutational sensitivity analysis was done for binding free
energy hotspots and residues E406, K417, N439, K444, E484, F486, and N501 targeted by
widely circulating and antibody-escaping mutations. Alanine scanning and mutational
sensitivity profiling of protein residues were performed using the BeAtMuSiC
approach.122,123 If
a free energy change between a mutant and the wild type (WT) proteins
ΔΔG= ΔG
(MT)-ΔG (WT) > 0, the mutation is destabilizing, while when
ΔΔG < 0 the respective mutation is stabilizing. The
BeAtMuSiC approach is based on statistical potentials describing the pairwise
inter-residue distances, backbone torsion angles, and solvent accessibilities and
considers the effect of the mutation on the strength of the interactions at the interface
and on the overall stability of the complex.122,123 The reported protein stability and binding free energy
changes are based on the ensemble averages of BeAtMuSiC values using equilibrium samples
from reconstructed simulation trajectories..

Perturbation Response Scanning (PRS) approach124,125 was used to estimate residue response to external forces
applied systematically to each residue in the protein system. This approach has
successfully identified hotspot residues driving allosteric mechanisms in single protein
domains and large multidomain assemblies.126−131 The
implementation of this approach follows the protocol originally proposed by Bahar and
colleagues126,127
and was described in detail in our previous studies.96 In brief,
through monitoring the response to forces on the protein residues, the PRS approach can
quantify allosteric couplings and determine the protein response in functional movements.
In this approach, it 3N × 3N Hessian matrix
H whose elements represent second derivatives of the
potential at the local minimum connect the perturbation forces to the residue
displacements. The 3N-dimensional vector
ΔR of node displacements in response
to 3N-dimensional perturbation force follows Hooke’s law
F = H × ΔR. A
perturbation force is applied to one residue at a time, and the response of the protein
system is measured by the displacement vector ΔR(i) =
H–1F(i)
that is then translated into N × N PRS matrix. The
second derivatives matrix H is obtained from simulation
trajectories for each protein structure, with residues represented by
Cα atoms and the deviation of each residue from an
average structure was calculated by
ΔRj(t) =
Rj(t) –
⟨Rj(t)⟩, and
corresponding covariance matrix C was then calculated by
ΔRΔRT. We sequentially perturbed each
residue in the SARS-CoV-2 spike structures by applying a total of 250 random forces to
each residue to mimic a sphere of randomly selected directions. The displacement changes,
ΔRi
is a 3N-dimensional vector describing the linear response of the protein
and deformation of all the residues..

Using the residue displacements upon multiple external force perturbations, we compute
the magnitude of the response of residue k as
⟨∥ΔRk(i)∥2⟩ averaged over
multiple perturbation forces F(i), yielding the
ikth element of the N ×
N PRS matrix.126,127 The average effect of the perturbed effector site i
on all other residues is computed by averaging over all sensors (receivers) residues
j and can be expressed as
⟨(ΔRi)2⟩effector.
The effector profile determines the global influence of a given residue node on the
perturbations in other protein residues and can be used as a proxy for detecting
allosteric regulatory hotspots in the interaction networks. In turn, the
jth column of the PRS matrix describes the sensitivity
profile of sensor residue j in response to perturbations of all residues,
and its average is denoted as
⟨(ΔRi)2⟩sensor.
The sensor profile measures the ability of residue j to serve as a
receiver of dynamic changes in the system..

A graph-based representation of protein structures132,133 is used to represent residues as network
nodes and the inter-residue edges to describe noncovalent residue interactions. The
details of graph construction using residue interaction cutoff strength
(Imin) were outlined in our previous studies.96 The network edges that define residue connectivity are based on
noncovalent interactions between residue side chains that define the interaction strength
Iij according to the following expression
used in the original studies:132,1331where nij is
the number of distinct atom pairs between the side chains of amino acid residues
i and j that lie within a distance of 4.5 Å.
Ni and
Nj are the normalization factors for
residues i and j. We constructed the residue interaction
networks using both dynamic correlations134 and coevolutionary residue
couplings135 that yield robust network signatures of long-range
couplings and communications. The details of this model were described in our previous
studies.135−137 More specifically, the
edges in the residue interaction network are then weighted based on dynamic residue
correlations and coevolutionary couplings measured by the mutual information scores. The
edge lengths in the network are obtained using the generalized correlation coefficients
RMI
(Xi,
Xj) associated
with the dynamic correlation and mutual information shared by each pair of residues. The
length (i.e., weight) wij =
−log[RMI
(Xi,
Xj)] of the
edge that connects nodes i and j is defined as the
element of a matrix measuring the generalized correlation coefficient
RMI
(Xi,
Xj) as between
residue fluctuations in structural and coevolutionary dimensions. Network edges were
weighted for residue pairs with
RMI
(Xi,
Xj) > 0.5 in
at least one independent simulation as was described in our initial study.135 The matrix of communication distances is obtained using the generalized
correlation between composite variables describing both dynamic positions of residues and
coevolutionary mutual information between residues. As a result, the weighted graph model
defines a residue interaction network that favors a global flow of information through
edges between residues associated with dynamics correlations and coevolutionary
dependencies. To characterize allosteric couplings of the protein residues and account for
cumulative effect of dynamic and coevolutionary correlations, we employed the generalized
correlation coefficient first proposed by Lange and Grubmüller.138 The g_correlation tool in the Gromacs 3.3 package was used that allows computation of
both linear or nonlinear generalized correlation coefficients.139 The
protocol was previously introduced and detailed in our earlier study,135 showing that the generalized correlation coefficient based on dynamic and
coevolutionary couplings provided a robust metric for detecting the cross-correlation
between protein residues. A similar strategy for analysis of allosteric motions and
interactions was successfully undertaken and improved in series of illuminating studies by
Palermo and colleagues140−143 where the introduced generalized correlation (GC) matrix
proved to be a sensitive and accurate method for detecting the interdependence of
spatially distant residues, providing a reliable and reproducible measure of how much the
motion of one residue is dependent on the fluctuations of another spatially separated
residue..

The RING program144,145 was also employed for the initial generation and analysis of residue
interaction networks. The ensemble of shortest paths is determined from the matrix of
communication distances by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.146 Network
graph calculations were performed using the python package NetworkX.147
The betweenness of residue i is defined as the sum of the fraction of
shortest paths between all pairs of residues that pass through residue
i:2where gjk
denotes the number of shortest geodesics paths connecting j and
k, and gjk
(i) is the number of shortest paths between residues j
and k passing through the node
ni..

The Girvan–Newman algorithm148−150 is used to
identify local communities. In this approach, edge centrality (also termed as edge
betweenness) is defined as the ratio of all the shortest paths passing through a
particular edge to the total number of shortest paths in the network. The method employs
an iterative elimination of edges with the highest number of the shortest paths that go
through them. By eliminating edges, the network breaks down into smaller communities. The
algorithm starts with one vertex, calculates edge weights for paths going through that
vertex, and then repeats it for every vertex in the graph and sums the weights for every
edge. However, in complex and dynamic protein structure networks, it is often that number
of edges could have the same highest edge betweenness. An improvement of
Girvan–Newman method was implemented, and the algorithmic details of this modified
scheme were given in our recent studies.151,152 Briefly, in this modification of Girvan-Newman method,
instead of a single highest edge betweenness removal, all highest betweenness edges are
removed at each step of the protocol. This modification makes community structure
determination invariant to the labeling of the nodes in the graph and leads to a more
stable solution. The modified algorithm proceeds through the following steps: (a)
calculate edge betweenness for every edge in the graph; (b) remove all edges with highest
edge betweenness within a given threshold; (c) recalculate edge betweenness for remaining
edges; (d) repeat steps b–d until the graph is empty..

The residue betweenness is then used to rank the most influential nodes in the network
and communities. For defining community leader nodes, we follow the Leader-Follower
algorithm, in which a community is defined as a clique and is characterized by the
presence of a leader and at least one “loyal follower”.153 Community leaders are defined as nodes that (a) are connected not only to members of
the local community but also have neighbors outside of the community; and (b) whose
distance to other nodes in the network is less than the neighbors in their respective
communities. These nodes could either directly link different communities or are connected
to isolated bridging nodes between communities. A loyal follower in a community is defined
as a residue node that only has neighbors within this single community. To characterize
global bridges from a community structure, we introduce community bridgeness metric
similar to Rao-Stirling index.154−156 this
parameter uses as input a prior categorization of the nodes into distinct
communities:3where the sum is over communities J
(different from the community of node i, denoted as I),
δiJ is equal to 1 if there is a link between node
i and community J and 0 otherwise.
liJ corresponds to the effective distance
between community I and community J as measured by the
inverse of the number of links between them. Nodes that are only linked to nodes of their
own community, i.e., loyal follower nodes have G(i) = 0,
while community leader nodes involved in bridging two (or more) communities have a
positive value of the index. All topological measures were computed using the python
module the python package NetworkX147 and Cytoscape platform for
network analysis.157.

Multiple CG-CABS simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 domain complexes with the ACE2
host receptor were performed to analyze similarities and differences in th conformational
dynamics profiles of the RBD regions and specifically binding interface residues (Figure 2). We combined CG-CABS simulations with the
atomistic reconstruction of simulation trajectories to characterize regions of structural
stability and plasticity at the ACE2 binding interfaces and determine the effect of the
complete S1 domain in the complex on flexibility of the interacting residues and
functional RBD regions. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative computational
analysis of S1 domain binding with ACE2 initiated to understand structural and dynamic
rearrangements of the S1 domain to form a stable monomeric complex with ACE2. The
conserved core of SARS-CoV-RBD consists of five antiparallel β strands with three
connecting α-helices (Figures 1 and 2). The central β strands (residues 354–363, 389–405,
423–436) in SARS-CoV-2 RBD are stable and, as expected, only small thermal
fluctuations were observed in these regions (Figure 2A). The antiparallel β-sheets (β5 and β6) (residues
451–454 and 492–495 in SARS-CoV-RBD) that anchor the RBM region to the
central core also displayed a significant stabilization in the complex with ACE2. The
small α-helical segments of the RBD (residues 349–353, 405–410, and
416–423) also displayed significant stability in simulations. These regions become
even more rigidified in the complex formed by the dissociated S1 domain (Figure 2B). Of special interest were the ACE2 induced changes
in the RBM region (residues 437–508) and particularly in a stretch of residues
471–503 involved in multiple contacts with the ACE2 receptor. The overall similar
RBM profiles in all systems were seen, but the greater stabilization of the interfacial
residues in the ACE2 complex was observed for the bound S1 domain structure (Figure 2A,B). The interfacial loop residues
436–455 containing an important motif 444-KVGGNYNY-451 displayed significantly
reduced fluctuations. Among residues that experience a more pronounced stabilization in
the complex are K417, G446, Y449, Y453, L455, F456, Y473, A475, and G476 positions in the
middle segment of the RBM (Figure 2C-E). The
analysis of the intermolecular contacts in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 complexes with ACE2
(Supporting Information, Tables S1–S3) indicated a significant number
of RBM interactions formed by the middle segment of the interface (K417, Y453, L455, F456,
and Q493) with K31 and E35 of ACE2 which may explain a pronounced stabilization of these
positions in simulations. Indeed, K417 forms contacts with D30 and H34 hotspot ACE2
residues, L455 is involved in interactions with K31 and D30, and F456 forms stabilizing
contacts with D30, K31, and T27 ACE2 hotspots (Supporting Information, Tables S1–S3). Another group of residues in
the RBM ridge involved in multiple binding contacts included E484 and F486 sites that
interact with K31, Q24, M82, and L79 of ACE2 (Supporting Information, Tables S1–S3). Notably, this analysis showed
that the interacting RBD motif 495-YGFQPTNG-502 is involved in the most persistent
interaction contacts with ACE2 that is exemplified by stabilization of Y489, F490, Q493,
Y495, G496, Q498, T500, and Y505 residues (Figure 2). These RBD residues form the largest number of contacts with ACE2 (Supporting Information, Tables S1–S3) and experienced the most
significant stabilization in the complex (Figure 2A,B). Importantly, not only these residues showed markedly reduced fluctuations
but also the large interfacial stretch of residues across the entire binding interface
(residues 486-FNCYFPLQSYGFQ-498) including key Q493 and Q498 interacting sites exhibited
even a stronger stabilization in the complex formed by the dissociated S1 domain (Figure 2B)..

(in maroon lines). (B) The RMSF profiles from simulations of the structures of the

S-RBD sites L455, F456, S459, Q474, A475, F486, F490, Q493, and P499, whose mutations
can abolish binding affinity with ACE2, are shown in yellow filled circles. The S-RBD
sites N439, L452, E484/P470, Q498, and N501, whose mutations could enhance binding
affinity for ACE2, are shown in blue filled circles. The S-RBD sites E406, N439, K417,
E484, and N501 targeted by novel circulating mutations and antibody-escaping mutations
are highlighted in red filled squares. (C) Structural mapping of the conformational
dynamics profiles in the SARS-CoV-2 S–RBD complex with ACE2 (PDB id6M0J). A ribbon-based protein
representation is used with coloring (blue-to-red) according to the protein residue

(D, E) Structural mapping of the conformational dynamics profiles in the S1 domain
complexes with ACE2 (PDB id 7A91
and 7A92, respectively). The
stability profile for protein residues is shown as in panel C using a coloring
spectrum from blue to red to highlight changes from rigid to more flexible
regions..

Structural maps of the conformational dynamics profiles highlighted these observations
showing a more uniform and broad stabilization of the RBD regions in the complex formed by
the dissociated S1 domain (Figure 2C-E). Although
the overall fluctuation profile of the RBM residues remained largely unchanged, we noticed
small but important differences pointing to the greater stability of the 495-YGFQPTNG-502
loop in the ACE2 complex with the dissociated S1 domain. These observations are consistent
with the latest structural studies showing that ACE2 binding can induce disassembly of the
SARS-CoV-2 S trimer and promote the formation of a stable dissociated monomeric S1 complex
with ACE2 receptor. At the same time, a modest mobility of the RBM positions N439, L452,
T470, E484, Q498, and N501 was seen in the S1-ACE2 complex (Figure 2B). Importantly, several of these positions, N49, E484, and N501,
correspond to sites that confer mutational variants with the increased binding to ACE2 and
elevated level of transmission and infectivity. The observed partial flexibility of this
SARS-CoV-2 RBM motif in the complex formed by the dissociated S1 domain may allow for
tolerance and adaptability of these sites to specific modifications resulting in the
improved binding affinity with ACE2..

We also report the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) ratio in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and
S1 domain complexes with ACE2 that were obtained by averaging the SASA computations over
the simulation trajectories (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The antiparallel β-sheet regions
in the SARS-CoV-2 (residues 451–454 and 492–495) are deeply buried at the
interface. The key RBM residues in the central segment (K417, L456, F456, Y473, F490, and
Q493) also showed small RSA values, indicating that these positions are buried in the ACE2
complex. Of particular interest were the average RSA values for functional sites E406,
K417, N439, E484, and N501 that are the central focus of our investigation. We found that
E406, K417, and N439 showed moderate RSA values (∼20–30%) indicating that
these positions could retain a certain degree of plasticity in the RBD and S1 domain
complexes with ACE2 (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The more extreme cases were exemplified
by E484 that maintains significant solvent exposure (RSA ∼ 65%) in the ACE2
complexes, while N501 is largely buried with very small RSA values (Supporting Information, Figure S1). However, conformational dynamics
profiles indicated that N501 may still maintain some level of plasticity in the ACE2
complex..

To compare the differences in the local flexibility with experimental functional data, we
specifically analyzed a group of SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues L455, F456, S459, Q474, A475,
F486, F490, Q493, and P499 whose mutations to their SARS-CoV RBD counterpart positions
resulted in the abolished binding affinity.37 It could be noticed that,
in the S1 domain complex with ACE2, these residues become appreciably more stable than
residues from another group (N439, L452, T470, E484, Q498, N501) that are more susceptible
to affinity-improving mutations. Functional studies showed that N439/R426, L452/K439,
T470/N457, E484/P470, Q498/Y484, and N501/T487 modifications of these SARS-CoV-2 RBD
residues to their respective position in SARS-CoV-RBD can, in fact, result in the enhanced
binding affinity for ACE2.37 Our analysis allowed to capture these
subtle differences showing that this group of RBD residues may experience larger
fluctuations (Figure 2A,B). Interestingly, these
differences become more evident only in the ACE2 complex with the dissociated S1 domain,
suggesting that the partial redistribution of mobility in the S1-ACE2 complex could
provide more room for structural adaptation of N439, E484, and N501 positions (Figure 2B). Hence, a moderate level of residual
fluctuations can be preserved even when RBM residues are involved in strong stabilizing
contacts with ACE2. Although E484 interacts with the K31 interaction hotspot residue of
hACE2, this residue retains a more significant degree of mobility and plasticity in the
RBM region which may be associated with the mutational variability and emergence of the
E484K variant that can improve binding affinity with the host receptor. Interestingly, we
found that escape mutations and variants improving binding affinity with the ACE receptor
may emerge in sites that are moderately flexible in the S1-ACE2 complex. This suggested
that, although some of these positions such as K417 and N501 are involved in multiple
contacts with ACE2, there should be substantial energetic plasticity in the interaction
network. According to our findings, there may be more room for tolerant modifications of
N439 and E484 positions, while the potential for favorable mutations at K417 and N501
sites could be more limited..

To summarize, the central finding of this analysis is that the conformational dynamics
profile for the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD residues remained largely conserved among ACE2 complexes
of the S1-RBD and fully dissociated S1 domain. Another important observation is a
consistent trend for moderate residual mobility of RBD residues whose mutations may often
lead to the enhanced binding with ACE2. Conformational dynamics analysis also indicated
that RBM residues targeted by novel mutational variants may be adaptable and display a
range of flexibility, from more dynamic positions at N439 and E486 to more constrained
K417 and N501 residues..

To characterize collective motions and determine the distribution of hinge regions in the
SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S1 domain complexes with ACE2 (Figure
3) and REGN-COV2 antibody combination (Figure
4), we performed PCA of trajectories derived from CABS-CG
simulations and also determined the essential slow modes using ENM analysis. The reported
functional dynamics profiles were averaged over the first three major low-frequency modes.
For comparison of ACE2-induced changes in the functional dynamics, we first characterized
the slow mode profiles for the unbound forms of the RBD and S1 domain extracted from the
crystal structures of the complexes (Figure 3A–C). For the unbound RBD structure, the local minima associated with
local hinge points corresponded to W353, F374, F400, L452, R466, Q493, and V510 residues.
Some of these residues, L452 and Q493, are involved in the interactions in the complex,
and their immobilized hinge position in the unbound form may be important to induce the
optimal intermolecular association with ACE2. Interestingly, none of the functional
positions targeted by novel mutational variants that promote infectivity and antibody
resistance (E409, K417, N439, E484, and N501) corresponded to hinge positions in the
unbound RBD form. In fact, E484 residue is located in the moving region of the unbound RBD
structure in slow modes (Figure 3A). The unbound
form of the dissociated S1 domain featured local hinge positions in residues F518 and
V539, C538, and F592 (Figure 3B,C). Strikingly,
these findings are consistent with our recent analysis of collective dynamics in the open
and closed forms of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer structures showing that these residues
correspond to major regulatory centers of functional motions and coordinate global
displacements of the S1 regions with respect to more rigid S2 subunit in distinct timer
states.158.

of their respective mobility in the low frequency slow modes..

Consistent with these studies, the functional movements of RBDs can be determined by the
main hinge centers located near F318, S591, F592, and V539 residues. These results
highlighted the conserved nature of global hinges in the dissociated S1 domain and in the
SARS-CoV-2 S complete trimer. Notably, the RBD residues targeted by novel mutational
variants are located in the flexible moving regions of the unbound S1 domain. The
distribution of hinge sites is altered in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with ACE2, and
strikingly the sites subjected to circulating variants and escape mutations often
coincided with hinge clusters anchored by E406, K417, N439, and N501 residues (Figure 3D). E484 is located near F486 that is aligned
with another local hinge position, while N501 together with T500 and Y505 can form a
dominant hinge center in the complex. Hence, a group of functional residues that include
N439, F486, T500, N501, and Y505 sites may form a network of regulatory centers
coordinating global movements of the RBD and ACE2 molecules. These findings are in line
with studies of conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoprotein in
complex with ACE2 revealing these positions may be involved in the regulation of
continuous swing motions of ACE2-RBD relative to the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer.33 The slow mode profiles obtained for complexes of the dissociated S1 domain
with ACE2 further highlighted the role of these functional residues in collective motions
(Figure 3E,F). The entire RBD region and
structurally conserved C-terminal domain 1, CTD1 (residues 528–591) become largely
immobilized in the S1 domain complex with ACE2 complex, while C-terminal domain 2, CTD2
region (residues 592–686) can undergo large movements (Figure
3F). By zooming on the RBD regions, one could see that local
minima and corresponding hinge sites are almost precisely aligned with residues E406,
K417, N501, and Y505. Hence, the RBD residues targeted by mutant variants may play an
important role in coordinating the relative orientation and approach angle of the ACE2
receptor in the complex and, consequently, affect recognition and signal transmission in
the functional complex. Structural maps of functional dynamics profiles illustrated these
findings showing that the RBD regions that include functional positions E406, N439, and
N501 are aligned with immobilized in slow motions hinge centers, while K417 and E484
residues could be less constrained during collective movements (Figure
3G–I). The central finding of this analysis is the
unique role that positions targeted by novel variants (N439, N501) and escape mutations
(E406) could play in concerted functional movements of the S-RBD and S1 domain when bound
to ACE2. On the basis of the results, we argue that the functional role of these sites in
controlling global motions and long-range interactions in ACE2 complexes could be an
important reason for mediating escape from antibody binding while maintaining and
enhancing binding with the host receptor..

To compare the slow mode profiles of the SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD complexes with ACE2 and
neutralizing antibodies, we performed ENM-based modeling of slow mode profiles in the
S-RBD complex with REGN-COV2 cocktail of two antibodies REGN-10933 and REGN10987 (Figure 4). This analysis showed that sites E406 and
K417 corresponded to local hinge positions, while N439 and K444/G446 residues are now
aligned with the dominant hinge center of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with the REGN-COV2
cocktail (Figure 4A)..

Importantly, antibody binding altered the dynamic role of residues E484 and N501 that
become aligned with moving regions in the collective dynamics of the complex (Figure 4A). Structural mapping of the essential
profiles further illustrated this point, showing that functionally immobilized in
collective motions hinge centers are localized near E406, N439, and K444 sites, while E484
and N501 positions could undergo some movements in the complex (Figure
4B). In this context it is particularly interesting to compare
our observations with functional studies showing that K417 and F486 are sites of escape
from RERGN10933, while mutations in K444 and G446 escape neutralization by REGN10987 and
E406 is a unique site susceptible to mutations escaping both antibodies.70 In line with these experiments, we found that E406 and K444 positions may
correspond to the antibody-specific unique hinge centers of collective motions that
control relative orientation and rigid body movements of REGN10933 and REGN10987 molecules
(Figure 4B). This is in some contrast to
SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes with ACE2 in which N439 and N501 form the major hinge center of
functional dynamics. As a result, it is possible that mutations in K444 and E406 positions
may perturb not only local interactions with antibody molecules but alter the global
collective movements and long-range communication, which may be sufficient to trigger
mutational escape from antibody binding. At the same time, these mutations could only
moderately change the SARS-CoV-2 RBD local interactions with ACE2 without affecting the
collective movements in the complex..

To summarize, this analysis suggested that mutational variants and escape mutations may
preferentially target specific positions involved in regulation and coordination of
functional dynamics motions and allosteric changes in the SARS-CoV-2 complexes with ACE2
and REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail..

We first performed a systematic alanine scanning of the SARS-CoV RBD S protein residues
(Figure 5A) and residues from the dissociated
S1 domain in the complexes with the ACE2 host receptor (Figure 5B,C). Using the equilibrium ensembles obtained from simulation
trajectories, we evaluated the average cumulative mutational effect of alanine
substitutions on protein stability and binding affinity with the host receptor. The
alanine scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues highlighted a significant destabilization
effect caused by mutations of G446, Y453, L455, F456, F486, Y489, Y495, T500, and Y505
residues (Figure 5A). These residues also
corresponded to the binding free energy hotspots in the complexes formed by the
dissociated S1 domain with ACE2 (Figure 5B,C). In
particular, large destabilization effects were observed upon mutations of Y453, L455,
F456, Y489, and F490 residues in the S1-ACE2 complexes. Notably, the largest
destabilization changes were produced by alanine mutations of F456 and Y489 residues,
displaying clear and pronounced peaks of the profile and pointing to these positions as
key binding affinity hotspots in the S1-ACE2 complexes. (Figure 5B,C). Several key binding energy hotspot sites (Y453, Y489, and
Y505) are conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins and are located in the
central segment of the interface. A detailed analysis of the intermolecular contacts in
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 complexes with ACE2 aided in understanding the binding energy
preferences of RBD residues (Supporting Information, Tables S1–S3). This analysis is particularly
instructive by considering contact distributions with two virus-binding hotspots on ACE2
formed by interacting residues K31 and E35 as well as K353 and D38..

the protein residues are shown in maroon bars. The binding interface residues are
depicted in orange filled circles and functional residues K417, E484, and N501
targeted by mutational variants are highlighted in magenta filled circles..

In particular, Y489 residue makes numerous favorable contacts with multiple ACE2 residues
K31, F28, Y873, L79, and T27 residues, while another hotspot position, F456, forms
interactions with T27, D30, and K31 positions on ACE2 (Supporting Information, Tables S1–S3). L455 residue of the RBD makes
favorable contacts with the key hotspots on ACE2 K31, H34, and D30 while Q493 contacts
K31, H34, and E35 positions. The hydrophobic residue F486 forms multiple interactions with
M82, L79, Y83, Q24, while another hydrophobic RBD site F490 interacts with K31 and Y473
with T27 (Supporting Information, Tables S1–S3). Overall, the alanine scanning
highlighted the importance of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD interactions formed by the middle segment
of the RBM interface (K417, Y453, L455, F456, Y489, and Q493) as mutations of these
residues resulted in a significant loss of binding affinity (Figure 5A-C). These results are consistent with recent functional studies,
indicating that mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues (L455/Y442, F456/L443, F486/L472,
F490/W476, Q493/N479) result in a significant reduction of their binding affinity with
ACE2.37.

The alanine scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues in the complex with REGN-COV2
antibody cocktail revealed large destabilization effects and strong peaks at positions
K444, V445, F456, F486, and Y489 (Supporting Information, Table S4, Figure 5D). The largest free energy changes exceeding 3 kcal/mol were observed for
alanine modifications of F456 and F486 residues which is consistent with the prominent
role these residues play in eliciting antibody-escaping mutations.70 We
also specifically highlighted binding free energy changes caused by alanine modifications
in sites targeted by circulating and antibody-escaping variants E406, K417, N439, E484,
and N501. The results showed that alanine substitutions in these positions induced only
minor destabilization changes in the RBD-ACE2 and S1-ACE2 complexes, and these values were
particularly small when mutations were introduced in E484 and N501 positions (Figure 5A–C). A slightly different pattern was
seen in the RBD-REGN-COV2 complex, where alanine modifications in K417, N439 and E484
residues led to appreciable >1.0 kcal/mol binding free energy loss, while mutations in
E406 and N501 positions produced only a small destabilization effect. These patterns
indicated that antibody binding may induce changes in the binding interactions and
distribution of the binding energy hotspots..

To further quantify the effects of the binding energy hotspots, we followed up with a
complete mutational sensitivity analysis of these RBD positions (Figure
6). The profiling showed that all mutations in Y453, F456,
F486, and Y505 positions were highly destabilizing (Figure 6A–D), while, for L455 and F490 positions, the loss of
binding affinity was only moderately destabilizing for the majority of substitutions
(Figure 6E,F). The destabilization pattern
observed for all modifications of F456 and F486 residues is consistent with the functional
experiments37 highlighting the importance of these positions in
binding affinity. We also conducted mutational sensitivity scanning of K417, E484, and
N501 residues that are targeted by circulating variants in the UK (B.1.1.7/501Y.V1), South
Africa (501Y.V2), and Brazil (B1.1.28/501.V3) lineages59−65 as well as profiling of E406 and N439 sites
that are of considerable interest due newly emerging circulating variants and
antibody-escaping mutations (Figure 7). Of
special interest was the analysis of the protein stability and binding free energy changes
incurred by N501Y mutation that is prominently featured in the UK B.1.1.7 variant and
mutations K417N, E484K that together with N501Y modifications are central to the increased
transmission and infectivity effects seen in the South Africa (501Y.V2) and Brazil
(B1.1.28/501.V3) lineages. In addition, we considered other important sites of newly
circulating mutations N439 and the unique position E406 giving rise to unique
antibody-escaping mutations.70,81.

Consistent with the deep mutational scanning experiments,35,66 we found that E406, N439, and E484
sites are energetically adaptable and can effectively tolerate different mutations without
incurring significant changes in protein stability and binding affinity (Figure 7A,C,D). Somewhat larger but still relatively tolerable
were binding free energy changes induced by mutations in K417 and N501 positions (Figure 7B,E). K417 is a unique ACE2-interacting
residue that forms favorable contacts with central residues of the ACE2 interface H34 and
D30 (Supporting Information, Table S1–S3). However, an appreciable
energetic plasticity could be seen in mutational sensitivity profiling of K417 residue
(Figure 7B). Although K417 mutations to alanine
or glycine produced fairly significant destabilization changes, K417N and K417D mutations
led to only small perturbations (∼0.4–0.5 kcal/mol). Indeed, deep mutational
scanning suggests that the K417N mutation has minimal impact on binding affinity with
ACE2.35.

The results also predicted the marginal improvement in the binding free energy mediated
by E484K mutation, and only a very modest increase in the binding affinity upon K417N
modification (Figure 7D). The experimental
studies indicated that the E484K mutation may induce a moderate improvement in binding
affinity and showed that other single mutations of E484 may only slightly compromise spike
folding stability and binding affinity for ACE2.35,70 According to our analysis, several hydrophobic
substitutions in this position (E484I, E484 V, E484F, E484W, and E484P) may, in fact, lead
to the moderately improved affinity, while other mutations appeared to produce only
marginal destabilization (Figure 7D). These
results indicated significant plasticity of this important RBD position that is relatively
exposed and may favor hydrophobic residues in this position to improve both stability and
binding. The mutational sensitivity profiling at the N501 position is consistent with deep
mutational scanning experiments35,66 reproducing the improvements in binding mediated by N501F and N501Y
mutations (Figure 7E). Indeed, deep mutation
scanning showed that N501F, N501T, and N501Y mutations may lead to moderate enhancement of
binding with ACE2, while N501D is an affinity-decreasing mutation.35 We
observed only a small destabilization effect for N501T and more significant
destabilization upon N501D and N501A/G mutations (Figure 7E). Importantly, these results supported the notion that N501Y mutational
variant could be beneficial for ACE2 binding, while escaping neutralizing antibodies
targeting the same region..

We also performed a mutational sensitivity analysis of the key functional positions in
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex the REGN-COV2 (Figure 8A–D). The results revealed moderate changes upon mutations at E406,
E484, N501, and N439 positions. Interestingly, although E406W escaped both individual
REGN-COV2 antibodies,70 our results indicate that this mutation would
not drastically perturb the RBD region and significantly affect the binding interactions
with the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail (Figure 8A).
Hence, the antibody-escaping effect of E406W substitution may not be trivially linked to
the local interaction effects. In this context, given the results of functional dynamics
analysis, it is tempting to argue that mutations at the E406 position may instead alter
collective movements and compromise long-range allosteric couplings in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
This may ultimately affect the neutralization activity of the REGN-COV2 antibody
combination. At the same time, a wide range of modifications at K417, K444, and F486 sites
resulted in significant destabilization changes and loss of the binding affinity (Figure 8E–G). These results are in excellent
agreement with functional mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues that affect the binding
of the REGN-COV2 cocktail showing that F486 mutations are predominant for escaping
neutralization by REGN10933 and mutations at K444 evade binding of REGN10987
antibody.70.

Consistent with the functional analysis of the immune-selected mutational landscape in
the S protein, we found that a wide spectrum of K444 modifications induced a significant
loss of binding free energy (Figure 8E) including
K444E and K444N mutations that showed a broad-range resistance against multiple
antibodies.69 The large destabilization changes caused by F486
mutations can be contrasted to fairly small changes incurred by E484 mutations, indicating
that the E484 site is characterized by a sufficient level of structural plasticity and
energetic adaptability to readily accommodate mutations in complexes with ACE2 and
REGN-COV2 cocktail. These findings may explain why single-site mutations of these residues
can only slightly change binding affinity for ACE2 and folding stability, while
double-site mutations of proximal E484 and F486 can significantly weaken the fitness of
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region and binding.66.

To summarize, our results pointed to several interesting trends. First, mutational
sensitivity profiling of the conserved hydrophobic binding energy hotspots Y453, L455,
F456, F486, and Y505 consistently yielded large destabilization changes affecting folding
stability and binding to ACE2 receptor, making these positions unlikely candidates for
antibody escaping mutations as even small modifications in these positions could have a
severely detrimental effect on the spike activity. Second, we found that SARS-CoV-2
binding affinity could be strongly influenced by the virus-binding hotspot K31 and H34 in
the middle of the interface through an extensive interaction network with K417, Y453,
L455, F456, and Q493 residues. Finally, mutational analysis of K417, E484, and N501
positions implicated in new mutational strains and antibody-escaping changes showed that
these residues correspond to important interacting centers with a significant degree of
structural and energetic plasticity. Indeed, N501Y, E484K, and K417N mutations can result
in an improved or only slightly decreased affinity with ACE2. These results suggest a
hypothesis that antibody-escaping mutations target residues with sufficient plasticity and
adaptability to preserve a sufficient spike activity while having a more detrimental
effect on antibody recognition. These findings are particularly interesting in light of
recent functional studies66 showing that escape mutations target a
subset of sites in the antibody-RBD interfaces corresponding to binding energy hotspots.
Importantly, these experiments suggested that escape mutations are consistently those that
have significant deleterious effects on antibody binding but little negative impact on
ACE2 binding and RBD folds. On the basis of our findings, we argue that escape mutations
constrained by the requirements for ACE2 binding and preservation of RBD stability may
preferentially select structurally plastic and energetically adaptable allosteric centers
at the key interfacial regions to compromise antibody recognition through modulation of
global motions and allosteric interactions in the complex..

Allosteric molecular events involve a complex interplay of thermodynamic and dynamic
changes taken place on a long-time scale that are difficult to directly observe and
simulate. Perturbation-based computational approaches based on linear response theory
allow for sequential perturbation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein residues by applying random
forces to each residue while monitoring the protein response. By using this approach, we
can examine and quantify long-range couplings between the sites of local perturbations and
response..

Using the PRS method,124−127 we quantified the allosteric effect of each residue in
the SARS-CoV-2 complexes. The effector profiles estimate the propensities of a given
residue to influence dynamic changes in other residues and can be applied to identify
regulatory hotspots of allosteric interactions as the local maxima along the profile.
First, we computed the residue-based effector response profiles for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
complex with ACE2 (Figure 9A) and the complexes
formed by the dissociated S1 domain with ACE2 (Figure 9B,C). By comparing the PRS profiles in the ACE2 complexes with SARS-CoV-2
S1/RBD and REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail, we determined the distribution of regulatory
allosteric centers and highlighted a potential role of sites targeted by global
circulating mutations..

Strikingly, the effector profile of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with ACE2 featured two
major peaks corresponding to residues E606 and T500/N501, indicating that E406 and N501
positions are aligned with the regulatory centers that may control allosteric
communications in the complex (Figure 9A).
Several other notable peaks corresponded to W353, K417, N439, and L452 residues. Hence,
all known positions targeted by novel circulating mutational variants with the exception
of E484 corresponded to the effector peaks and are involved in the coordination of
allosteric communications in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with ACE2. Moreover, the effector
profiles indicated that these regulatory sites may function in a coordinated manner and
maintain an allosteric cross-talk to control signal transmission “traffic”
and long-range interactions in the RBD-ACE2 complex. Interestingly, several of these
effector centers L452, N439, and N501 were among SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues whose mutations
to the SARS-CoV RBD counterparts N439/R426, L452/K439, and N501/T487 enhanced the binding
affinity.37 The prominent role of these residues as regulatory
effector centers becomes even more apparent in the S1 domain complexes with ACE2 (Figure 9B,C). It is evident that E406, K417, N439 and
especially N501 positions corresponded to sharp peaks of the effector profile. This
implies that these sites may be collectively responsible for the coordination of
long-range communication in the system..

The central result of this analysis is that circulating and escape mutations appeared to
target residues corresponding to structurally and energetically adaptable regulatory
control points that can tolerate individual mutations and often enhance ACE2 binding,
while at the same time allowing for coordinated modulation of allosteric communications.
We suggest that allosteric signaling in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with ACE2 is adaptable
where a mutation of a regulatory control point can be functionally compensated through
energetic rebalancing of structurally plastic allosteric hotspots..

Using a protein mechanics-based approach,159 we also employed distance
fluctuations analysis of the conformational ensembles to further probe allosteric
communication preferences of the RBD residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 complexes with
ACE2. The residue-based distance fluctuation communication indexes measure the energy cost
of the dynamic residue deformations and could serve as a robust metric for the assessment
of allosteric propensities of protein residues. In this model, dynamically correlated
residues whose effective distances fluctuate with low or moderate intensity are expected
to communicate with higher efficiency than the residues that experience large
fluctuations. Notably, structurally stable and densely interconnected residues as well as
moderately flexible residues that serve as a source or sink of allosteric signals could
feature a high value of these indexes..

The distance fluctuation profile of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 domain complexes with ACE2
showed a small but important redistribution of major peaks, pointing to sites E406, W436,
N439, N501, and Y505 (Figure 9D). Notably, this
group of residues is featured prominently among peaks of the profile when the entire S1
domain monomer forms complex with ACE2 (Figure 9E,F). We also noticed that the overall shape and distribution of the peaks are
similar between the PRS effector profiles and distance fluctuation communication index
profiles. Notably, E406, N439, and N501 sites were featured as recurring peaks in both
distributions, strengthening the proposed notion that positions targeted by the emerging
mutational variants can cooperate and play a central role in the regulation of long-range
couplings and allosteric communications in the complexes with the ACE2 host receptor.
Hence, the distance fluctuation profiling and analysis of communication indexes provide
important supporting evidence to the PRS modeling, suggesting that structurally stable
positions and potential allosteric hotspot residues only partially overlap, and allosteric
hubs may exhibit a certain degree of structural plasticity and energetic adaptability to
enable a balance between binding and signaling function..

To understand a potential role of the E484 residue, it is instructive to analyze the PRS
sensor profile (Supporting Information, Figure S2). A comparison between sensor profiles
obtained for the unbound and bound forms of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD showed that the E484
position is aligned with the dominant peak of the sensor profile in the unbound form
(Supporting Information, Figure S2A). Interestingly, in the complex with
ACE2, this site also corresponded to a major sensor peak at the binding interface
(Supporting Information, Figure S2B). Structural mapping of sensor profiles
in the unbound and bound RBD forms illustrated these observations, pointing to the role of
E484 residue as a major receiver site of allosteric signaling in the RBD-ACE2 complex
(Supporting Information, Figure S2C,D). Hence, the PRS analysis of the
RBD-ACE2 and S1-ACE2 complexes demonstrated that, while E406, K417, N439, and N501 are
aligned with dominant effector positions representing the source and regulatory points of
allosteric signaling, E484 corresponded to a major sensor/receiver site that may absorb
signal information. Collectively, these sites may represent key nodes of the allosteric
interaction network in the functional ACE2-bound complexes and determine the robustness
and efficiency of signal transmission..

We also computed the PRS effector profiles for the SARS-RBD complex with REGN-COV2
antibody combination (Figure 10). The effector
profile revealed some redistribution of peaks, featuring V401/E406, N439, K444/G446, and
G496 positions as major effector centers (Figure 10A). At the same time, residues E484/F486 and N501 were aligned with the local
sensor peaks (Figure 10B). These results could
provide a feasible rationale for the critical role of K444 and F486 positions in escaping
antibody combinations. Indeed, K444 is a central epitope residue for REG10987, while F486
residue is fundamental for the recognition of the REG10933 antibody.70
Our findings also indicated that E406 and K444 are the dominant effector centers in the
RBD complex with REGN-COV2 (Figure 10A) and may
be functionally important not only for binding affinity but also for mediating signaling
and long-range communications in the complex. In the context of the perturbation-based PRS
model, this implies that single mutations at these positions could affect collective
movements and allosteric couplings between many residues in the system and potentially
compromise the functional activity of the REGN-COV2 cocktail. Interestingly, other
positions targeted by antibody-escaping mutants E484 and F486 are the major sensor sites
(Figure 10B). On the basis of these
observations, we suggest that allosteric control of the RBD-REGN COV2 complex is provided
through a cross-talk between major effector sites (E406, K444) and receiver sites (E484
and F486)..

To summarize, perturbation-based modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes suggested that
functional residues targeted by global circulating variants and antibody-escaping mutants
could form a network of structurally adaptable allosteric hotspots that collectively
coordinate allosteric interactions in the system. These results bear some significance and
support the latest illuminating study suggesting a model functional plasticity and
evolutionary adaptation of allosteric regulation.160 This
function-centric model of allostery revealed remarkable functional plasticity of
allosteric switches allowing modulate and restore regulatory activity through mutational
combinations or ligand interactions. Our results similarly suggested that functional
plasticity and cross-talk of allosteric control points in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region can
allow for differential modulation of recognition and long-range communication with ACE2
and antibodies..

Structure-based network approaches have offered a powerful conceptual formalism and an
array of robust computational tools for describing allosteric interactions.161 Network-centric models of protein structure and dynamics used in the
current study provide a complementary perspective to the physics-based analysis of
conformational dynamics landscapes and allow for quantitative analysis of allosteric
changes in which conformational landscapes of protein systems can be remodeled by various
perturbations such as mutations, ligand binding, or interactions with other
proteins.162 Another emerging concept central to computational models
of allostery is the identification of regulatory control points that mediate long-range
communications and allosteric pathways between conformational switch
centers.161,162 Our
current understanding of communication pathways in proteins is based on the ensemble-based
statistical model that often invokes community-based methods for modeling ensembles of
intermodular pathways and analysis of the modular organization of protein structure
networks.135−137 Using community
decomposition, the residue interaction networks can be divided into local interaction
modules in which residues are densely interconnected and highly correlated during
simulations, while different communities are connected through long-range couplings. A
community-based model of allosteric communications is based on the notion that groups of
residues that form local interacting communities are correlated and switch their
conformational states cooperatively. In this model, allosteric communications can be
transmitted through a chain of stable local modules connected via intercommunity
bridges.135−137 In the present study,
we leveraged the results of community decomposition and used edge betweenness in the
global interaction network as a proxy for modeling of allosteric communication pathways
and assessment of antibody-induced modulation of allosteric interactions in the SARS-CoV-2
S proteins. Using this computational framework, we set out to explore allosteric
communications and identify functional centers in the spike protein that propagate
cooperative structural changes through modular community structure..

Using this network-centric description of residue interactions, we compared the
organization of stable local communities in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes with ACE2 (Figure 11) and REGN-COV2 cocktail (Figure 12). In the RBD-ACE2 and S1-ACE2 complexes, we found a
deeply interconnected community organization (Figure 11) where stable modules in the RBD core are tightly linked with the interfacial
clusters. A number of stable intramolecular communities in the RBD core contribute to the
stability of the RBD regions. Some of these communities are formed by hydrophobic core
residues including F342–V511–F374–W436-F347-R509,
W353–F400–Y423, as well as E406-Q409-I418 and N439–443-P499 centered
around functional residues E406 and N439 (Figure 11). Of particular interest and importance was a more detailed comparative
analysis of the intermolecular communities. In the RBD-ACE2 and S1-ACE2 complexes, these
modules are integrated around key anchor residues K417, F456, Y489, N501, and Y505. The
largest and most stable community in which each node is strongly linked with each other is
centered on N501 (K353-D38-Y41-Q498–N501-Y505) and engaged ACE2 hotspots K353, D38,
and Y41 (Figure 11A). This interfacial module
anchored by N501 allows for persistent interactions by N501, Y505, and Q498 RBD residues.
Moreover, this community may be instrumental for signal transmission between RBD and ACE2
molecules, highlighting the important role of the N501 position. By introducing the N501Y
mutation, we rebuilt the residue interaction network and performed community
decomposition, which revealed the preservation of this major community. This observation
supported our energetic analysis indicating structural plasticity and stability of the key
intermolecular communities in the RBD-ACE2 complex..

residues are shown in spheres and annotated. Notably, these two major intermolecular
communities that mediate communications and stability of the interface include several
key functional sites, K417, F456, E484, and N501, targeted by mutational variants and
antibody-escaping mutations..

cocktail of antibodies. (A) A general community overview of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD
complex with REGN-COV2. The RBD is in red ribbons, and interfacial communities are
shown in red spheres. (B) A close-up of the intermolecular communities formed by the
S-RBD. The communities at the interface with REGN10933 include
F486(RBD)-E484(RBD)-Y489(RBD)-R100(REGN10933)-Y50(REGN10933)-Y59(REGN10933)-L94(REGN10933)
and K417(RBD)-E406(RBD)-Q409(RBD)-Y32(REGN10933)-T102(REGN10933). The interfacial
community with another antibody in the complex is
W99(REGN10987)-W47(REGN10987)-G446(RBD)-V445(RBD)-K444(RBD)-Y59(REGN10987) that is
anchored by K444, V445, and G446 residues connected with Y59 and W99 of REGN10987..

Another group of interfacial communities is anchored by K417 and F456 positions that
couple modules Y489–F456–K31 and D30–K417-F456 (Figure 11B). Interestingly, these intermolecular communities
are directly coupled through K417 with the intramolecular module
I402–I418-E406-Y495-Q409 centered on the E406 residue. Hence, the community
organization revealed strong interconnectivity between key functional sites E406, K417,
F456, and N501 that integrate the residue interaction network and enable allosteric
couplings between RBD and ACE2 molecules. The important revelation of this analysis is
that only a fraction of the RBD residues anchor the intermolecular community organization
and mediate long-range interactions in the RBD-ACE2 complex. Furthermore, the binding free
energy hotspots are not necessarily involved in community-mediating functions. Instead, a
group of structurally plastic allosteric centers such as E406, K417, F456, and N501 plays
key roles in integrating local communities into a robust and adaptable global network that
can mediate signal transmission and communication between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2..

The REGN-COV2 antibody binding induced a partial and yet significant reorganization of
the interface communities (Figure 12A). We found
that key RBD residues F486, Y489, and K417 anchor major intermolecular communities with
REGN10933 including R100–Y50–F486-W47-L94, Y32-T102-K417, and Y33-T52-Y489
(Figure 12B). Interestingly, K417 and another
site of escape mutations E406 are interconnected in the local RBD community
E406-Q409–K417-I418. E484 is involved in the formation of the intermolecular
contacts with T52, Y53, T57, Y59 residues of the heavy chain of REGN10933 and could bridge
several interfacial communities anchored by F486 and Y489 residues. Among major
interfacial communities formed by the RBD with REGN10987 is the
W99–W47–V445–K444-Y59 module, in which V445 and K444 play a key role
in mediating intermolecular communication. Another notable community is anchored by T500,
which engages N439, P499, K444 residues of the RBD and W99 of the heavy chain of REGN10987
(Figure 12B). These findings are consistent
with the experimental deep mutational screening showing that K444 is a critical RBD
residue for REGN10987, while F486 and Y489 sites are essential in inducing the activity of
REGN10933. According to these experiments, mutations F486I and Y489H escape REGN10933, and
E484A/F486I combinations evade REGN10933. Interestingly, it was also established that
mutations at F486 escaped neutralization only by REGN10933, whereas mutations of N439 and
K444 escaped neutralization only by REGN10987..

E406 site is at the center of the largest intramolecular community in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
(R403–Y453–V350-I418–N422–Y423-Y495-F497-E406-Q409) that
connects the intermolecular interfaces with the RBD core (Supporting Information, Figure S3). This site could anchor large communities
in the core with the interfacial regions facing both antibodies. On the basis of these
observations, we suggested that unique escape mutations in the E406 position may be
largely determined by its allosteric mediating role in interconnecting functional regions
of the RBD. Given the fact that E406 is only involved in several contacts with T28 of
REGN10933, the strong mutational escape effect may be mainly driven by long-range
allosteric effects and attributed to the strategic position of this residue in the global
network. Noticeably, E406 is closely connected with the Y453 residue, where another
REGN10933 specific escape mutant Y453F was detected.70 Another key
member of this community is F497 that effectively bridges local intermolecular modules
interacting with REGN10933 and REGN10987 antibodies (Supporting Information, Figure S3). Recent studies indicated that SARS-CoV-2
neighbor residues G496 and F497 are critical for the RBD–ACE2 interaction and that
F497 may play an important role in enhancing the RBD–ACE2 interaction for
SARS-Cov-2 RBD. Our network analysis quantifies the structural hypothesis offered in the
experimental study according to which E406 escape mutation may affect recognition by
REGN10987 through cascading effect onto adjacent structural elements across the RBD and
propagating changes through aromatic residues Y453, Y495, and F497.70
Importantly, network analysis revealed that these hydrophobic residues belong to the
tightly packed stable community anchored by the E406 residue. Owing to the modular
interconnectivity where each of these residues is connected with every community neighbor,
it is likely that E406W mutation may simultaneously perturb multiple contacts and alter
couplings between these residues, thus adversely affecting the fidelity of allosteric
communication with REGN10987. Hence, although this residue makes no persistent contact
with either of the interacting antibodies, its position in the largest community anchored
by E406 could be important for the integrity of the network organization in the complex
with antibodies..

The network analysis showed that not only are these residues involved in favorable
contacts with these antibodies but also they define key regulatory nodes that mediate
stability and connectivity of the intermolecular communities and may be responsible for
the control of signal transmission between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and REGN10933/REGN10987
antibodies. In agreement with functional data, the network community analysis singled out
N439, K444, F486, and Y489 sites as allosteric network hubs where mutations would result
in weakening of the entire interface and compromise the efficiency of allosteric
interactions..

This integrative computational investigation combined molecular simulations and
functional dynamics analysis with mutational energetic profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein binding and network-based community modeling to delineate specific allosteric
signatures of functionally important residues that are subjected to novel circulating
variants. The proposed computational framework is based on the notion that dynamic
characterization of functional allosteric states and atomistic reconstruction of
conformational energy landscapes enables to unravel mechanisms of binding-induced
modulation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein activity. Although all-atom MD simulations with the
explicit and detailed characterization of the glycosylation shield can provide a truly
comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the conformational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 S
proteins, such simulations remain to be extremely computationally demanding due to the
size of the system. The adopted approach in our study represented an opportunistic
strategy in which the robustness and simplicity of high-resolution CG simulations to
adequately probe conformational space were combined with atomistic reconstruction of the
simulation trajectories. The global dynamic and network features of the spike protein
landscapes are assumed to be largely determined by the underlying topology of the
SARS-CoV-2 S structures and can be captured through a proposed combination of CABS-CG
dynamics and subsequent atomistic refinement of trajectories with structurally resolved
glycans. This simulation approach enabled efficient conformational sampling and
topological characterization of the energy landscapes, hinge regions, and regulatory
switch centers that may control binding-induced modulation of conformational changes in
the SARS-CoV-2 S structures..

Using the conformational energy landscapes of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins as the conceptual
core of our strategy, we conducted the ensemble-based mutational scanning of spike protein
residues to assess local binding propensities and affinities with specific antibodies as
well as perturbation-response scanning in which global allosteric propensities of spike
residues are profiled to determine functional allosteric hotspots of the SARS-CoV-2 S
regulation. These approaches mimic deep mutational scanning experiments by averaging over
equilibrium samples and provide valuable complementary information about binding energy
hotspots that drive local changes in the binding affinity and global allosteric hotspots
that are involved in the coordination of allosteric communication and regulatory control
of SARS-CoV-2 S binding with antibodies Through mutational and perturbation-based scanning
we independently profiled binding and allosteric propensities of the SARS-CoV-2 S
proteins, showing structural and energetic plasticity of the important allosteric hotspots
that corresponded to the sites of the emerging global circulating mutations. The important
revelation of this dual profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the fact that
allosteric regulatory centers may not necessarily correspond to the binding free energy
hotspots, suggesting that antibody-escaping mutational variants would likely to emerge in
dynamically adaptable regions important for allostery as this “strategy” my
enable virus to preserve the stability of the spike fold and retain favorable interactions
with the host receptor while compromising protein response and allosteric signaling to
antibodies. By combining the dynamics and ensemble-based scanning of the SARS-CoV- S
binding with modeling of the residue interaction networks and community analysis, our
integrated strategy linked allosteric properties of functional spike regions with their
mediating role in global interaction networks. Using this computational framework, we
found that efficient allosteric communications in SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins could be
controlled by allosteric functional centers that bridge local stable communities and serve
as key “stepping stones” of allosteric communications and long-range
interactions in the SARS-CoV-2 S complexes with antibodies. Collectively, the application
of synergistic computational approaches allowed for quantitative characterization of
molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, suggesting that functionally important
spike sites subjected to global circulating mutations may emerge due to evolutionary
adaptation in structurally plastic and energetically tolerable positions that play a
unique and critical role as global mediators of allosteric interactions and communications
of SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding. We argue that evolutionary adaptation in the SARS-CoV-2 S
proteins may operate on functionally critical allosteric sites, such as sites of global
circulating mutations, by using only minimal perturbations while achieving global protein
response through allosteric signaling propagated through conserved interaction network
scaffolds..

Comparative modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 S complexes with ACE2 and REGN-COV2 antibody
combination revealed several important trends and characterized the unique
allosteric-centric signatures of functional spike residues. Conformational dynamics and
analysis of global motions in the SARS-CoV-2 S complexes demonstrated that the RBD residues
targeted by novel mutational variants may be structurally adaptable and play a central role
in the regulation of collective movements and long-range couplings. Through mutational
sensitivity analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues, we accurately reproduced the binding
affinity changes for N501Y, E484K, and K417N mutations and found that these important
interacting centers are characterized by a significant degree of structural and energetic
plasticity. Using PRS analysis and community modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 S complexes, we
characterized signatures of functional residues implicated in novel variants and
demonstrated that these sites form a network of energetically adaptable regulatory centers
modulating long-range communication of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD regions with ACE2 and
antibodies. The results of this study demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein may
function as a versatile and functionally adaptable allosteric machine that exploits the
plasticity of allosteric regulatory centers to fine-tune the response to antibody binding
without compromising the activity of the spike protein. By examining molecular mechanisms of
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding with antibodies through the lens of dynamic allosteric
analysis and network modeling, we identified the functional centers in the spike protein
that can be exploited for manipulating conformational landscapes of the SARS-CoV-2 S
proteins, design of allosteric modulators, and potential engineering of ligand-specific
regulatory responses ,which may be useful for tailoring new therapeutic interventions to
combat potential antibody-escaping resistance..
