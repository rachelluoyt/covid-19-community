The emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern with
increased transmission dynamics has raised questions regarding stability and
disinfection of these viruses. In this study, we analyzed surface stability and
disinfection of the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and
B.1.351 compared to the wild type. Treatment with heat, soap and ethanol
revealed similar inactivation profiles indicative of a comparable susceptibility
towards disinfection. Furthermore, we observed comparable surface stability on
steel, silver, copper and face masks. Overall, our data support the application
of currently recommended hygiene concepts to minimize the risk of B.1.1.7 and
B.1.351 transmission..
