The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially the Delta variant that became the dominant variant in the US and UK within weeks, necessitates a rational assessment of their impact on the recognition and potential neutralization of the virus by the host cells..

We carried out an extensive comparative analysis of the interactions of the variants with cognate molecules (ACE2, furin, or heparin), neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using in silico models and simulations, in addition to Nb-binding assays conducted for the Delta variant..

The results shed light on the molecular origin of experimental observations and help make predictions on the impact of variants that have not been experimentally established to date. Notably, the increased ACE2-binding affinity of variants containing the N501Y or E484K mutations can be traced to the time-dependent disruption and/or formation of interfacial salt bridges, not necessarily apparent from structural models but detected by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. The analysis also explains why the South African variant has an increased tendency to evade mAbs such as REGN10933 (casirivimab), LY-CoV016 (etesevimab), LY-CoV555 (bamlanivimab), BD23, and C105 or the nanobody H11-H4, while being insensitive to others including REGN10987 (imdevimab). Simulations also show the distinctive response of the Delta variant to different antibodies, including the minimal effect on the neutralizing activity of the nanobody Nb20, which is confirmed by our experiments. This contrasts the reduction in the potency of the Eli Lilly mAb LY-CoV555..

Of interest are critical substitutions T478K, L452R and P681R in the Delta variant that may explain its increased transmissibility. The former two tend to enhance the associations with ACE2 and heparin. The third, P681R, located at a putative superantigenic site, plays a critical role in enhancing the efficiency of proteolytic cleavage and thus accelerating viral entry, because the polybasic wildtype motif P681RRAR serving as recognition site for the polyacidic binding epitope of furin-like proteolytic enzymes is rendered even more basic and attractive upon this substitution. The distinctive behavior of the variants vis-à-vis different types of Abs highlights the significance of carrying out full-atomic structure- and dynamics-dependent studies for assessing the specific response of different Abs to newly emerging variants..

The high transmissibility and mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 together with the lack of a robust pre-existing immunity by the hosts [15, 16] and slow rate of immunization through vaccinations have caused COVID-19 cases to surge to more than 200 million worldwide, resulting in over 4.2 million deaths by the end of July 2021. There is an urgent need to prevent infection through extensive vaccination and/or treat COVID-19 and associated multi-system inflammatory syndromes (MIS) through effective therapies either by monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments or antiviral compounds [17–19]. While Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were authorized for emergency use in the US, the UK and EU in December 2020 and January 2021, and the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK and EU, and the Johnson & Johnson one in Feb 2021, the duration of immune protection, the ability to protect populations across all age groups, as well as the capacity to produce sufficient doses of safe and effective vaccines remain to be determined [21]. Most importantly, their efficacies against emerging variants ought to be carefully monitored. New SARS-CoV-2 variants have been noted to exhibit higher transmissibility and to possibly evade the host immune response [22–25]. The pace of vaccination has not been fast enough to control the spread of the virus and the accompanying emergence of new variants (see Table 1), leading to the current surge of the Delta variant as the dominant variant currently (8/2021) observed in the USA, UK, most of the EU, and other countries. Real-time tracking of virus lineages has been enabled by large scale genomic surveillance and collaborative online data sharing platforms [26, 27], allowing emerging lineages to monitored and studied at an unprecedented rate. As of August 13th, 2021, a total of 2,765,274 SARS-CoV-2 sequences have been listed in the GIASID database (https://gisaid.org)..

Given the current surge of the Delta variant, and the possible emergence of new variants, it is essential to assess their anticipated ability to recognize host cells or to escape the immune response. Here we conduct a molecular assessment driven by structural data and advances in in silico modeling and simulations to evaluate the effects of the mutations in the spike (S) glycoprotein of the variants on viral-host protein interactions. While the receptor binding domain (RBD; residues 331-524) has been a focal point in many studies, due to its major role in binding the human receptor ACE2 and infecting host cells [28, 29] as well as recognition by the immune system, making it (or the mRNA encoding it) an important component of many vaccines [30], we also realize that several mutations entail other domains including in particular the vicinity of the S1/S2 cleavage site P681RRAR↑S [31], which would affect the interactions with the furin-like proteases (and other host factors such as neuropilins [32]). The RBD is targeted by the majority of mAbs from COVID-19 patients and mAb therapies under investigation, although other potential neutralizing epitopes have also been reported [2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20, 33–35]. Here we perform a systematic computational study, complemented by experiments, for a predictive evaluation and comparison of the effect of mutations on the molecular interactions that mediate viral entry as well as those potentially neutralizing the variants. We focus in particular on the molecular impact of mutations that have distinguished the South African (Beta), and more recently the Delta, variants..

While the variants all contain multiple substitutions and deletions in the spike (e.g., the Kent, UK, Alpha variant B.1.1.7 contains eight), a small number of sites exhibit mutations arisen independently in multiple lineages. These include the N501Y mutation in the UK, South African (SA, Beta), and Brazilian (Gamma) variants; K417, which is mutated to N in the South African and Delta+ variants and to T in the Brazilian variant; and the E484K mutation in the South African and Brazilian variants [36] as well as more recent variants in areas around Bristol and Liverpool in the UK [37] and the B.1.525 variant (variant under investigation VUI-202102/03) discovered in the UK and Nigeria [38]. Understanding the effect of these substitutions on the transmissibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the effectiveness of mAbs known to neutralize the wild-type (wt) S, is of broad and immediate interest. Some of these have been studied in deep scanning mutagenesis [39–44], in vitro evolution [45–49], cryo-EM [50, 51], computational studies [52–54] and antibody-binding experiments focused on variant mutations [48, 55–62], but a systematic analysis of the effect of selected variants (with multiple mutations on the spike glycoprotein) is lacking..

The Delta variant (SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.617.2) was initially detected in India in December 2020 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) amidst a surge in COVID-19 cases and associated hospitalizations and deaths. Surveillance and modelling data indicated that the Delta variant quickly became the dominant variant in England, as well as many other countries, including the USA, usurping the formerly successful Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant. The Delta variant has by far the highest growth rate of detected variants, reflecting both the biological properties of this variant and the context in which it is transmitting, and has been associated with increased risk of hospital admission [63]. Of great interest, one of its mutations (P681R) falls into the SARS-CoV2 superantigen-like motif that we have discovered at the furin cleavage site of the virus [20, 64], which has been found to be a key site in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis [65]..

In the present study, we first focus on the impact of the RBD-associated amino acid substitutions N501Y, E484K and K417N/T on the interactions of the RBD with the host cell receptor ACE2 and neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) and mAbs using a suite of molecular modeling and simulations. Our comparative analysis shows that the mutation K417N/T acts to counterbalance the high affinity of the spike imparted by the mutation N501Y (shared by the Kent, South African and Brazilian (respective Alpha-, Beta-, and Gamma-) variants). However, E484K turns out to stabilize a new salt bridge (with ACE2), suggesting a net increase in transmissibility. As to the structurally characterized mAbs (Table 2), several of them, including one of the two Regeneron mAbs used in combination [3], do not make direct 3D contacts with these mutated residues; and others engage in compensating interactions such that their efficacy would not be effectively altered. In contrast, a weakening in the interactions is discerned in the cases of mAbs C105 [1], BD23 [8], REGN10933 [3] and the Nb H11-H4 [11]..

We further examined the effect of the substitution L452R shared by the Delta (Indian) and Epsilon (Californian) variants on the interactions with selected Abs. e.g., Eli Lilly LY-CoV555 [4] and an ultrapotent inhalable nanobody Nb20 [12]. While L452R mutation weakens the interaction with, and potentially reduces the efficacy of, selected mAbs (e.g. Eli Lilly LY-CoV555 [43]) due to the loss of favorable hydrophobic interfacial contacts, this weakening is compensated by an intermittently-formed new salt bridge between T478K and Nb20 (LY-CoV555 does not have a similar salt bridge). Consistent with our computational predictions, experiments conducted with Nb20 showed a comparable if not slightly increased affinity to bind the Delta variant, compared to the WT spike..

Finally, we focused on the P681R mutation at the furin cleavage site of the spike, which also takes part in the superantigen-like motif of the spike [20, 64]. Molecular modeling and simulations of the structure and interactions of the Delta variant Spike (triple mutant L452R, T478K, and P681R) with ACE2, heparin, and furin suggested that these substitutions may increase the ability of the variant to bind ACE2, heparan sulfate and furin, all of which would enhance and/or facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry, possibly providing a molecular basis for the increased infectivity of the Delta variant..

Current computational predictions together with experimental validations draw attention to the necessity and utility of evaluating the potential ability of newly emerging variants to escape immunotherapy, or evade specific mAbs or Nbs, the response being highly sensitive to atomic interactions and even their time evolution in the hundreds of nanoseconds range. Such structure-based in silico protocols, which can be readily adapted to new variants, may help provide insights into the molecular bases for the increased cell entry and infectivity at the microscopic level, which might be contributing to transmissibility or increased virulence at the population level..

We considered the variants listed in Table 1, and the set of mAbs and Nbs compiled in Table 2, along with the corresponding structural data to investigate the change in their interface and interaction dynamics imparted by the spike glycoprotein mutations compared to the wild type S. Likewise, the impact on the interactions with ACE2 and furin has been investigated. Details on the structural data used as input are provided below (see Table 2)..

The structure of the complex formed by wt S RBD and ACE2 was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6LZG [13]). To characterize the changes in interfacial interactions imparted by the amino acid replacements in the new variants (Table 1), we generated structural models using CHARMM-GUI for five mutant RBDs complexed with ACE2: (1) N501Y; (2) E484K; (3) N501Y and E484K; (4) K417N, E484K, and N501Y; and (5) L452R and T478K. The generated models were further refined using the refinement protocol implemented in the webserver HADDOCK 2.4 [66]. Refinement was performed by MD energy minimization following the protocol and default parameters provided by the webserver. Binding free energies were evaluated using the inter-residue contact-based method accessible in the webserver PRODIGY [67] based on HADDOCK-refined structures. Similar modeling and simulations were performed for the complexes of the same variant with a series of Abs using as template the PDB structures listed in Table 2. Those resolved at low resolution (e.g., BD23) were also subjected to energy minimization prior to modeling and simulations. Interactions were also visualized in PyMOL [68] using mutagenesis and sculpting wizards for rotamer optimization..

To assess the accuracy of PRODIGY [67], we first compared the ACE2 binding affinities of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, based on the MD-energy-minimized crystal structures (PDBs: 6LZG [13]) and 2AJF [69]) by HADDOCK [66]. The calculated ACE2/RBD binding affinities by PRODIGY were -11.0±0.3 Kcal/mol (KD
 8.1 nM), and -12.1±0.3 kcal/mol (KD
 1.4 nM), for SARS and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, which fall within similar ranges to in vitro binding measurements showing that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds ACE2 with 4-10 nM affinity, which is about 6-10 fold tighter than that of the SARS-CoV S-protein [70–72]..

To investigate the effect of the RBD mutations on the binding to ACE2, we constructed six different molecular dynamics (MD) simulation systems using CHARMM-GUI [73] based on the resolved crystal structure of WT RBD/ACE2 complex (PDB: 6LZG) for (i) the WT RBD and the mutants (ii) N501Y, (iii) E484K, (iv) E484K+N501Y, (v) E484K+N501Y+K417N, and (vi) L452R + T478K. For each simulation system, fully equilibrated TIP3P waters were explicitly added to build a simulation box of 138×138 ×138 Å3; Na+ and Cl- ions were added to obtain a 0.15 M NaCl neutral solution. For each simulation system, three independent runs of 200-300 ns were conducted. Overall, the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) with respect to the resolved crystal structure converged to 2.75 ± 1.0 Å after 40-60 ns of simulation (not shown), indicating the stability of the simulated systems. Similar MD simulations were performed for the complexes of WT or South African variant with five selected mAbs, LY-CoV555, LY-CoV16, REGN10933, Ab 2-4 and BD38, using as template the PDB structures listed in Table 2. For each RBD/mAb system, two independent runs of 100-150 ns MD simulations were performed. All simulations were performed using NAMD [74] following the default protocol. VMD [75] with in-house scripts was used for visualization and trajectory analysis. The probability of selected interactions (e.g. salt bridges) was assessed by counting the number of times of observing atom-atom interactions within 4 Å distance for the examined amino acid pair, at 0.2 ns intervals during 100-300 ns trajectories. Assessment of changes in interaction energy (including vdW, electrostatic and non-bonded energies) between RBD and ACE2, or RBD and Abs, due to amino acid variations were performed using the pairInteraction module implemented in NAMD [74]..

The global dynamics of RBD-ACE2 complex was evaluated using the Gaussian network model (GNM) [76], as implemented in the DynOmics web server [77] and by essential site scanning analysis (ESSA) [78]. Both tools are accessible and described in detail in the open source ProDy API [79–81]. GNM analysis was used to determine the role of the mutation sites in the global dynamics of the RBD (wt or variant) complexed with ACE2, using broadly established analytical methods [82]. Briefly, we evaluated the conformational flexibility (or mean-square fluctuations (MSFs)) of residues in the three most cooperative modes of motions and identified the most constrained regions (i.e., minima in these MSFs plotted as a function of residue index, called global mobility profiles). These regions serve as anchors or hinges; as such they play a key mechanical role and cannot easily adapt to substitutions [83]. ESSA, on the other hand, determines the essential residues whose perturbation alters the frequency dispersion of global motions. Residue-based ESSA scores are evaluated based on three lowest frequency GNM modes. High scoring residues usually occupy functional (e.g. orthosteric or allosteric) sites [78]..

The three mutations L452R, T478K, and P681R carried by the Delta variant were generated using CHARMM-GUI [73], based on the WT Spike model from our previous studies [20, 64], which was constructed on the resolved SARS-CoV-2 spike with one subunit in the open conformation (PDB: 6VSB) [72]. Heparin binding poses were assessed by ClusPro [84] using the Heparin Ligand Advanced Option (dp4 heparin oligosaccharide). A crystal structure of human furin (Y110-A408; P09958) was used as is (PDB: 5JMO) [85] for spike-furin docking simulations by ClusPro [84], following our previous protocol for the WT spike [20]. Selected furin-spike complexes were further refined by HADDOCK 2.4 [66]. Refinement was performed by MD energy minimization following the protocol and default parameters provided by the webserver..

Proteins (WT SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Delta variant RBD) were coated onto 96-well ELISA plates at 3 μg/ml in coating buffer (15 mM sodium carbonate, 35 mM Sodium Bicarbonate, pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. The plates were decanted and washed with washing buffer (1x PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20) three times, and then blocked for 2 hours at room temperature in blocking buffer (1x PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 5 % milk powder). Nanobody (Nb) 20 was 5x serially diluted in blocking buffers starting from 2.5 μM with 8 different concentrations and incubated with the plate for 2 hours at room temperature. After three washes, anti-T7 tag HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo, cat#PA1-31449) were diluted at 1:7500 and incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hours. Upon washing, freshly prepared 3,3’,5,5’-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added to the plate for signal development in the dark for 10 minutes. The reaction was quenched with a STOP solution. The plates were measured at wavelengths of 450 nm with background subtraction at 550 nm. The raw data were processed and fitted into the 4PL curve using the Prism Graphpad 9.0. Each experiment was repeated three times..

Mutations at two amino acids, N501Y and E484K, engaged in interfacial interactions with the human receptor ACE2 (Figure 1A) have been the hallmark of the modified UK (Alpha), South African (Beta) and Brazilian (Gamma) variants. We focus first on N501. In the wt spike, N501 forms two hydrogen bonds with ACE2 residues Y41 and K353, resulting in a stable complex with a binding affinity of -12.1 ± 0.2 kcal/mol (Figure 1B). Note that for clarity ACE2 residues (and all non-spike residues in the following) will be written in italic, to distinguish them from spike residues. In the variants, N501Y mutation further induces three new associations with ACE2 (Figure 1B-C, lower panels): (i) a hydrogen bond with D38, (ii) a cation-π interaction with K353, and potentially a π-stacking interaction with Y41, resulting in an increase in ACE2-binding affinity to -12.6 ± 0.3 kcal/mol. Notably, during the entire durations of our simulations conducted for N501Y-associated variants, N501Y formed stable cation-π interactions with K353 as well as aromatic-aromatic interactions with Y41. Y41 and K353 have been reported to regulate ACE2-SARS binding: mutations to K353 (K353H or K353A or K353D) are known to disrupt interaction with the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein; and Y41A strongly inhibits interaction with the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein [86]. Therefore, in the Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-variants, the substitution N501Y is expected to promote ACE2 binding to potentially increase infectivity due to well-defined interactions, also indicated by deep mutational scanning experiments [44] as well as free energy perturbation studies [87]..

This analysis serves as a verification of the utility and relevance of the computational protocol adopted here (see Methods), which will be applied to shed light to less-studied cases..

Interfacial salt bridges between the RBD and ACE2 play a significant role to stabilize the binding of the RBD to ACE2. Dynamical formation and occupancy of these interfacial salt bridges are illustrated in Figures 1D and F for the WT virus and Southern African variant, respectively, and in Supplementary Figure S1A for a variant containing E484K and N501Y double mutations..

K417 is specific to SARS-CoV-2 S, compared with SARS-CoV. The salt bridge between K417 (RBD) and D30 (ACE2) assists in RBD-ACE2 binding [88]. Simulations show that this salt-bridge is highly stable (Figure 1D) and its occurrence probability (also called salt-bridge (SB) occupancy) of 0.59 ± 0.2 (averaged over 3 runs) is substantially higher than other (intermittently formed) interfacial salt bridges (Figure 1E). Interestingly, N501Y further stabilizes the K417-D30 salt bridge (to increase its occupancy to 0.81 ± 0.1; see Figure S1B); and the occupancy of K417-D30 remained high in all N501Y-associated variants. Clearly, the loss of this salt bridge by the mutations K417N and K417T would decrease the binding affinity. This has been observed for the Delta+ (B.1.617.2+) variant where the K417N mutation reduced ACE2 binding affinity by at least 3-fold relative to the Delta variant [89], possibly explaining its lower dominance, despite having presumably greater ability to escape from antibodies (see Section 3.3)..

The behavior of E484K was more complex. An interfacial salt-bridge between RBD E484 and ACE2 K31 was observed to intermittently form in the wt spike glycoprotein albeit with low occupancy (Figure 1D-E). In contrast, during all MD simulations carried out for the RBDs containing the E484K mutation, we invariably observed that a new interfacial salt bridge formed for relatively extended durations (up to 35% of the trajectory in the South African variant; Figure 1F-G) between E484K and E75. This salt bridge was also reported in a recent MD simulation study of E484K-associated mutants [90]. Notably, E484 is located in a loop region and undergoes significant conformational fluctuations enabling optimal (high affinity) interactions (Figure S1C-D); the probabilistic occurrence of K484-E75 (in the mutant) is significantly larger than that of E484-K31 (in the WT spike), revealing that the net effect of E484K mutation is to increase ACE2 binding affinity. This loop rearrangement was also seen to be important in a recent computational study[91] as well as our simulations with antibodies (Section 3.3)..

Simulations repeated (in triplicates) for single mutants N501Y and E484K, for the double mutant E484K+N501Y and the triple mutant E484K+K417N+N501Y (South African variant), compared to the WT, revealed that the double mutant E484K+N501Y exhibited the highest ACE2 binding affinity (-12.8 ± 0.3 kcal/mol), due to the simultaneous formation of the interfacial salt bridges K417-D30, K484-E75 and K458-E23 (Figure S1C, right). These results explain the increased ACE2 binding affinity of the E484K mutant observed in deep mutational scanning [44] and in vitro evolution experiments [45]..

In summary, out of the three mutations that define the Beta- or Gamma-variant, N501Y strongly promotes the association with the human ACE2 with strong amino-aromatic and aromatic-aromatic interactions; E484K further contributes to binding by electrostatic attraction to a charged residue (E75) that was otherwise ‘mute’. Notably, the third mutation K417N in the South African variant renders the spike relatively less attractive to the ACE2 (resulting in fewer interfacial salt bridges; Figure S1D), and may have helped moderate the infectivity of this variant. It should, however, be noted that these mutations also impact the ability of antibodies to bind to the RBD (see Section 3.3)..

In the structures resolved for WT RBD complexed with ACE2, L452 and T478 do not interact directly with the ACE2 (see Table 2; last row). Yet, given that simulations may induce conformational changes and expose newly formed interactions in the mutants, which are not evident from the examination of static structures or homology models (as observed in Fig 1D-G), we carried out multiple MD runs to observe possible formation of new interfacial associations between the Delta variant and ACE2. In contrast to E484K-associated mutants, no new associations were observed, despite the substitution of charged amino acids in L452R and T478K. The overall interfacial contacts with ACE2 resembled those of the WT RBD. Yet, careful evaluation of the electrostatic potential of the Delta variant RBD in comparison to the WT RBD shows a change in the surface distribution of charges, mainly more basic (positively charged) surface properties compared to the WT near the mutations T478K and L452R (Fig 2A). This change would enhance the propensity of binding of the Delta variant RBD to the negatively-charged ACE2 binding surface [44]. Taken together, our molecular modeling and simulations suggest that L452R and T478K may slightly increase ACE2 binding. However, this change in surface composition may not alone explain the high transmissibility of the Delta variant, especially in the absence of persistent interfacial interactions that involve these mutated residues..

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been shown to interact with both cellular heparan sulfate and ACE2 through its RBD [92]. Following previous work [92], we simulated the binding of heparin (heparan sulfate mimics) to the Delta variant using the docking software ClusPro [84] (see Methods). Two hot spots serving as heparin binding sites were identified in our simulations, which were in proximity of L452R and T478K (Fig 2B). The most probable heparin-binding site predicted by ClusPro is an inter-subunit location between two RBDs of the spike in the up and down conformations (Fig 2C), adjacent to the ACE2 binding site. It remains to be seen if T478K and/or L452R may enhance ACE2 binding via heparan-sulfate-facilitated ACE2 binding [92] or stabilization of the spike in RBD up conformations..

The third mutation characterizing the Delta variant, P681R, is adjacent to the polybasic stretch, R682RAR685 that serves as a furin-recognition motif, to enable the proteolytic cleavage of the spike at the adjacent site R685↑S686. Recognition of this furin cleavage site and ensuing cleavage of the spike into S1 and S2 subunits is essential for priming the spike for viral entry. Two natural consequences of cleavage are the acquisition of fusogenic properties by the S2 trimer, which is essential to viral entry; and the shedding of the S1 subunits whose presence in the extracellular medium and the circulation may have superantigenic [64] and/or pathogenic [93] consequences..

The substitution P681R renders the segment P681RRAR685↑S686 even more basic. The mutated stretch, RRRAR685↑S686, is expected to be more attractive to the acidic epitope on furin or other proteases, thus increasing the probability (or population) of cleaved spikes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the propensity of the Delta variant to bind to furin, compared to that of WT SARS-CoV-2 spike, which we have extensively studied in recent work [20]. The majority of furin-bound complex models generated by ClusPro confirmed that R681 is strongly attracted to the acidic residues at the furin epitope that binds the cleavage site, complementing the other basic residues in the polybasic motif of S. Fig. 2D illustrates such a highly stable binding pose between furin and the Delta variant. Three arginines, R681, R682 and R683, form a network of salt bridges with a series of acidic residues from furin. In particular, the mutated residue R681 in the Delta variant forms a new salt bridge (not present in the WT spike) with furin E257/E258, which provides a stronger association than that between P681 and E257 and P256 in the WT spike-furin complex. The spatial and sequential juxtaposition of the acidic residues E257 and E258, which serve as additional attractors to the segment RRRAR
685↑S686, directly implies an increased probability of interaction with furin – which also implies an increased probability of fusion upon release of the fusogenic S2 trimer, and increased S1 shedding to the extracellular region..

Collectively, our molecular modeling suggests that substitutions L452R, T478K and P681R in the Delta variant (i) tend to enhance ACE2 binding (due to the change in surface electronic properties at the binding face), (ii) facilitate heparan sulfate binding, which may further mediate an interaction with ACE2 [92], and (iii) promote proteolytic cleavage due to increased attraction to the acidic binding epitope of furin, resulting in increased S1 shedding. All these three effects add up to enhance viral entry. It is worth noting that increased S1 shedding and increased circulating S1 levels have been shown to correlate with more severe disease [93]. Furthermore, the location of the mutation P681R overlaps with a superantigenic region [64, 94, 95], which has been shown to be highly reactive and to elicit multi-inflammatory response..

We analyzed a set of twelve monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and two nanobodies (Nbs) whose structures complexed with the SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD have been resolved (Table 2, first column; H11-H4 and Nb20 are Nbs). Figure S2A displays their binding poses, generated by structurally aligning the spike or RBD regions of the corresponding S/RBD – Ab complex structures. Table 2 column 2 lists the spike residues that make interfacial contacts with the listed Abs..

First, we focus on the Abs that make contacts with the mutation sites (K417, E484, N501, L452, T478 and P681) and would clearly be expected to experience a change in their interaction strength with the Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and/or Delta-variants. Examination of the data shows that none of these Abs makes contact with T478 nor with P681 (which is not in the RBD); five of the listed mAbs, REGN10987 (imdevimab), 4A8, EY6A, HO14, and CR3022, do not make any contacts with any of these residues (Figure S2B), suggesting that their substitutions would not significantly affect the effectiveness of these mAbs. The remaining nine Abs (written in boldface) are engaged in direct contacts with one or more mutation sites. We elaborate on those Abs in the following..

C105 depends on K417 to coordinate a polar network that supports its high affinity to bind the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD. K417 forms a salt bridge with the C105 residues E96/E99 which also engage the RBD residue Y453 (highlighted by the red circle in Figure 3A). This network is completely abolished by the substitution K417N (Figure 3B). This significant loss in the attractive interaction is partially alleviated by a new favorable interaction between N417 and mAb Y52, and a cation-π interaction that Y501 makes with mAb K31, but the net effect is a reduction in binding affinity by 0.4 kcal/mol. The Gamma variant with the shorter residue T417 cannot form compensatory interactions (Figure 3C), suggesting greater escape from C105 and other antibodies interacting with this site, and potentially explaining its prolonged dominance in Brazil, Chile and Argentina..

The effect of mutations on the interaction with the Regeneron mAb REGN10933 (casirivimab; Figure 3D-I) is more complex. In the experimentally resolved wt S-REGN10933 complex, K417 forms a salt bridge with mAb D31 (as well as engaging T102), which in the mutant would be replaced by weaker polar interactions. This implies a weakening in the neutralizing efficacy of REGN10933. MD simulations, however, reveal a more complete picture, pointing to the importance of considering the adaptability of proteins to mutations, rather than considering their resolved (WT) structures only. Although the crystal structure of REGN10933 bound to WT RBD shows the single salt bridge K417-D31 only, two additional salt bridges R403-D31 and E484-R100 are observed to stabilize the interactions during simulations (Figure 3D and G). This is accompanied by a rearrangement of the loop containing E484 (and T478) as noted in a previous simulation study [91]..

Notably, the salt bridge R403-D31 partly compensates for the loss of K417-D31 in the SA variant (Figure 3E and H). However, the E484-R100 bridge is also lost, enabling further loop rearrangement and resulting in decreased efficacy of REGN10933. In the Delta variant, the T478K mutation generates a new salt bridge K478-D92 (Figure 3F and I), which may facilitate the retained binding of and neutralizing activity mAb REGN10933 to the Delta variant [96]. It is important to note that these compensating interactions or new associations, which were not evident in the original structures, emerged during full-atomic simulations of hundreds of nanoseconds. Therefore, an assessment exclusively based on structural modeling may provide a first estimate but not conclusive results, hence the importance of conducting extensive full atomic simulations for each case reported here..

Four other Abs, BD23, H11-H4, and Eli Lilly mAbs LY-CoV555 (bamlanivimab) and LY-CoV016 (etesevimab), also exhibited a weakening in their interaction with the spike in various variants, compared to WT, illustrated in Figure S3. In the case of the Eli Lilly mAb LY-CoV016 (PDB: 7C01, chains B and D), K417 makes a critical salt bridge with D104 and a cation-π interaction plus a hydrogen bond with Y52 in the WT RBD (Figure S3A). K417N eliminates the first two interactions but maintains the hydrogen bond in addition to making another one with Y33. For the Brazilian (Gamma) variant, K417T eliminates all interactions (Figure S3B). Notably in our MD simulations, the salt bridge of K417-D104 (LY-CoV016) remained stably formed during the entire duration of simulations; K417N abolished this interfacial contact point. Hydrogen bonds between N417 and Y33/Y52 partially compensated for the loss of the salt bridge in the South African variant, but PRODIGY calculations still predicted a 2-fold reduction in the binding affinity LY-CoV016 to South African (Beta) variant..

As to Eli Lilly LY-CoV555, E484 makes two critical salt bridges with mAb residues R50 and R96 (Figure S3C). E484K severely disrupts these interactions via charge repulsion. Indeed, during our MD simulations, we observed the departure of mAb LY-CoV555 from its initial contact pose with the South African RBD within 100 ns, confirming that the South African RBD could escape from mAb LY-CoV555. In addition, L452 is engaged in a network of hydrophobic contacts with LY-CoV0555 I54 and L55 in the WT spike (also complemented by L492) (Figure S3D). The L452R mutation breaks the favorable hydrophobic interactions and PRODIGY calculations showed a two-fold reduction in binding affinity of LY-CoV555 due to L452R mutation shared by the Epsilon (California)- and Delta (India)- variants in line with recent experiments showing reduced neutralizing activity by this antibody [96]. Yet, during 200 ns MD simulations, this variant RBD remained bound to LY-CoV555 due to the salt bridge stably maintained between E484 and R50/R96 (LY-CoV555). Clearly, a variant containing the double mutation E484K and L452R (not yet observed) could be completely detrimental to the neutralizing effect of LY-CoV555. The existing Kappa variant (B.1.617.1) containing E484Q and L452R [97, 98] is less able to escape from antibodies [89, 99, 100], which is likely due to Q484 being able to make hydrogen bonds in place of salt bridges..


Figure S3E-H present the results for BD23 and H11-H4. The WT E484 forms a salt bridge with BD23 R107 (Figure S3E), which, on the contrary, gives rise to a repulsion upon the substitution E484K in the variant (Figure S3F). A similar, even stronger effect is observed between the Nb H11-H4 and the RBD (Figure S3G-H) where the strong attractive interaction of wt RBD E484 with H11-H4 R52 turns into a strong repulsion between R52 and K484. Both cases are expected to have reduced potencies with respect to the variants containing the mutation E484K. Interestingly, BD23 also contains W105 in the vicinity of L452 (Figure S3E), raising the possibility that it might be even more effective against the Delta and Epsilon variants through formation of a W105-R452 cation-π interaction..

Finally, as a proof of concept, we explored the validity of our computational predictions with the help of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) performed for Nb20, an ultrapotent and inhalable nanobody to block WT SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Nb20 was examined for its binding to both the WT RBD and a mutant RBD that bears the critical residue substitutions (L452R and T478K) of the Delta variant (see Methods)..

In the case of the WT RBD, Nb20 forms a salt bridge E484-R31/R97 and hydrophobic interaction L452-M55 (see Figure 4A). During the MD simulations of the WT RBD-Nb20 complex, the E484-R31/R97 salt bridge remained quite stable with a percent occupancy of 96 ± 4 %. Additionally, a new salt bridge, K417-E100 was observed to form intermittently with a much lower fractional occupancy (0.08 ± 0.03). Notably a hydrophobic interaction between L452 and M55 was persistently maintained during MD simulations, suggesting that this association may play a substantial role in stabilizing the bound form of the Nb20..

In the case of the Delta variant, L452R promoted a new interaction with S52 via hydrogen bonding (Figure 4B). Interestingly, the T478K mutation favored a new salt bridge formation with E42/E44 (Figure 4B), with a fractional occupancy comparable to K417-E100 (0.07±0.03) (Figure 4C). In both WT and delta variant, the E484-associated salt bridges remained high stable (>95% occupancy), indicating that E484 was the most essential residue for binding Nb20; mutations breaking this salt bridge, e.g. E484K of the SA variant, would be expected to reduce, if not abolish, its ultrahigh-affinity binding to the RBD [60]. For the Delta variant, our modeling suggests that the hydrophobic interaction (L452-M55 in the WT) would not significantly contribute to the overall RBD binding energy due to L452R substitution. In addition, the loss of this interaction may be complemented by a new transient salt bridge K478-E42/E44, as well as the hydrophilic interaction between L452R and S52, such that the Delta variant would not be able to evade neutralization by Nb20..

In agreement with these computational predictions, Nb20 is observed in binding assays to retain (if not increase) its potency with respect to the Delta variant spike (Figure 4D). Notably, a previous experimental study found that L452R induced the Ab escape of LY-CoV0555 [43], which is also consistent with the disruption of the network of hydrophobic interactions (Figure S3C) which has been noted to be disrupted by replacing L452 by an arginine. This brings attention to the differential effects of L452R on the potency of different types of Abs..

Apart from interfacial interactions, it is of interest to examine the role of mutated residues in the structural mechanics of the spike and the complex it forms with ACE2. Gaussian Network Model (GNM) analysis [76] of the global dynamics of the RBD-ACE2 complex revealed that N501 plays a central mechanical role, participating in a hinge center (minimum in the global mobility profile) as illustrated in Figure 5A and D. Further analysis of essential sites by essential site scanning analysis (ESSA) [78] pinpointed some of the most ‘essential sites’ to two of the residues mutated in the South African variant (K417 and N501; in red), and two ACE2 residues (Y41 and K353; in blue), which have been reported [86] to regulate the ACE2-spike binding (Figure 5B). It is interesting to note that several residues gain functional importance (emerge as peaks) upon complexation of the spike with ACE2 (Figure 5C), including K417 and N501 in RBD, and D30, K31, Y41 and K353 in ACE2. Moreover, the mutation site L542 shared by both the Delta (Indian) and Epsilon (Californian) variants stands out in the isolated RBD due to its high ESSA score. In contrast, the Delta variant mutation site T478 does not exert a substantial effect on the global dynamics. We also identified a pocket in the immediate vicinity of K417 and N501 (and D30 and K31) at the RBD-ACE2 interface (Figure 5E), which is predicted by ESSA to potentially serve as an allosteric site that might interfere with the conformational dynamics of the complex. We note that an insightful study of the spike interactions with ACE2 and Regeneron mAbs, the authors also predicted N501 and K417 (and E406 and N439) as effectors of allosteric communication [101]. Note that we have not elaborated on E406 and N439 as these residues were not mutated in the examined variants, but our study also corroborates that these site have high allosteric potential, as evident by their high ESSA scores and sensitivity to complexation with ACE2 (Figure 5C)..

SARS-CoV-2 has shown significant mutations in recent months, which raised questions about the increased transmissibility of the variants, as well as their potential to evade mAb treatment. The high mutation rate may in part be responsible for the zoonotic nature of these viruses and points to a clear risk of still-undetected additional members of the coronaviridae family making the jump from their traditional hosts to humans in the future. To date there has been relatively limited evidence for the functional effect of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. First, attention was given to the D614G mutation in the S protein, which emerged early in the pandemic, and might be associated with increased transmissibility [102–105], and with escape from mAb and polyclonal serum mediated neutralization [106]. A study of 184 recurrent mutations (including D614G) in the dataset of 46,723 SARS-CoV-2 isolates, on July 30, 2020 showed, no evidence of increased transmissibility [107]. Yet, since then, the emergence of UK and South African variants which share the mutation N501Y have raised concerns of high transmissibility and potential adverse effects on the efficacy of neutralizing Abs, reminding that missense mutations in MERS and SARS-CoV resulted in resistance to neutralizing Abs [108] and immune-escaping variants may possibly arise through intra-host evolution in individuals with immunodeficiency and prolonged viral replication [109, 110]..

In the present study, we showed that structure-based modeling and full-atomic simulations can provide a good estimate of the anticipated effect of the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon variants, vis-à-vis their interactions with cognate proteins essential to viral entry, and their ability to escape neutralizing Nbs and mAbs. The study also provides molecular rationale for enhanced propensity of some variants (e.g. Beta- and Gamma- variants containing the mutations N501Y and E484K) to bind to human ACE2, as noted in earlier experiments [44] and computations [87]; or for the alterations in the neutralizing potential of specific mAbs and Nbs. Here, we examined 12 mAbs and 2 Nbs (Table 2) including two mAbs used in the Regeneron combination mAb therapy that has been granted emergency use authorization. Of the five mAb binding epitopes (Epitope I to V) identified [12] on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, residues E484 and K417 contribute to the binding of ultrapotent class I Nbs [60] and their mutations could be responsible for evading selected Abs. The interactions between the spike and six Abs — C105, BD23, REGN10933, LY-CoV555, LY-CoV016 and the Nb H11-H4, were indeed shown to be weakened due to (i) the disruption of the salt bridges that K417 formed with C105 E96/E99; REGN10933 D31 and LY-CoV016 D104 upon its replacement by N or T, (ii) the disruption of the WT E484 salt bridges with BD23 R107, LY-CoV555 R50 and R96, REGN10933 R100, and with H11-H4 R52 upon replacement of E by K; and (iii) the abolishment of a network of hydrophobic contacts that L452 makes with LY-CoV0555 I54 and L55 by substitution of R. It is worth noting that not all such interactions, and other compensating interactions are evident from the crystal structures. On the contrary, MD simulations of hundreds of nanoseconds revealed associations and dissociations that stabilized or destabilized the specific complexes, leading to the final assessments..

A recent mapping of RBD mutations that escape REGN-COV2 cocktail and Eli Lilly’s LY-CoV016 antibodies [42], using a deep mutational scanning method [41], revealed several sites whose point mutations mediate escape. K417 is indeed observed among those sites of ‘strong escape’ for REGN10933 (but not REGN10987) and our study (Figures 3 and S3) sheds light to the molecular origin of this behavior. Interestingly the mutation K417N is also the ‘top’ site of escape for LY-CoV016, as could be explained in Fig S3A-B. The study further revealed that F486 is the strongest such site that escaped neutralization by REGN10933, and K444-G446 escaped neutralization by REGN10987. We note that these residues make direct contacts with the respective mAbs (Table 2). But interestingly the mutation (E406W) escaped the cocktail of both REGN antibodies even though it does not make direct contacts with either mAb in the resolved structure, again inviting attention to the necessity of considering structural changes induced by such drastic substitutions, hence the need to conduct MD simulations as well as network-based analysis of allosteric dynamics (that revealed the critical mechanical roles of N501, Y505 and E406) as carried out here, and also demonstrated in a recent computational study [101]..

The Delta variant has been associated with increased transmissibility, disease severity, and breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals [96, 111–113]. Individuals infected with Delta exhibit viral loads up to 1,260 times higher than those in people infected with the original strain and have a shorter incubation period accounting for Delta’s heightened transmissibility [112]. Several questions about the Delta variant remain unanswered, including the molecular basis of the higher infectivity, and whether it is more likely to cause more severe disease than the original strain. The examination of the Delta variant required new considerations as the mutated residues (L452, T478 and P681R) were spatially different from those observed on other variants’ spike RBD..

The location of the Delta variant spike mutation P681R is worth special attention. SARS-CoV-2 uses the viral spike S for host attachment and entry. The host protease furin cleaves the full-length S glycoprotein into two subunits, S1 and S2, at the peptide bond connecting R685 and S686, i.e., in the close vicinity of the mutated P681. Cleavage prompts the conformational transition of the ‘freed’ S2 trimer into its fusogenic form required for entry to the host cell. The segment connecting the mutation and cleavage sites, P681RRAR685, has a polybasic character essential to recognition by (i) the polyacidic epitope of furin-like proteases that cleave the S protein, and (ii) surface neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and NRP2 receptors that serve as host factors for SARS-CoV2 cell entry and increased infectivity among other pleiotropic biological processes [32]. Our simulations demonstrated that the mutation rendered this site more attractive (than the WT) to furin (Figure 2B and D), which would thus enhance/accelerate proteolytic cleavage and thereby cell entry..

Another important aspect of this specific site P681RRAR685 is that it belongs to a putative superantigenic segment having sequence and structure features highly similar to those of a bacterial toxin, Staphyloccocal enterotoxin B (SEB), and exhibiting high-affinity nonspecific binding to TCRs potentially causing a cytokine storm or MIS-C [64]. Enhanced cleavage of S, and shedding of the S1 subunits would further expose the highly reactive C-terminal end R

685 of the superantigenic segment in the Delta variant, which might further escalate the hyperinflammatory responses elicited by the superantigen-like segment. Indeed, a recent study has observed that higher serum levels of circulating free S1 spike protein were associated with more severe disease among adult COVID-19 patients [93], as well as among children with severe MIS-C disease [95]. The key importance of this furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis has now been shown in several studies [65, 114]..

Given the importance of this furin cleavage site and the shed S1 in infectivity and disease pathology, it is of great interest that the two dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants, Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2), both have altered furin cleavage sites. In the Alpha variant, which was already 50% more contagious than the original Wuhan strain, the proline P681 was changed to a histidine (P681H); in the Delta variant, which is about 50% more contagious than the Alpha variant, it is changed to an arginine (P681R) [115]. Both changes make the sequence less acidic and more basic. The Delta variant with its P681R mutation in the superantigen-like motif that we described makes this already highly reactive sequence even more basic leading to a more effective recognition and binding of this site by the polyacidic furin motif. Our current simulations have indeed shown that the P681R binds more efficiently to furin, which would be expected to lead to more efficient cutting of spike and more S1/S2 cleavage products. Since cleavage is a prerequisite for viral entry to the host cells, more efficient binding and cleavage would mean more spike proteins primed to enter human cells and improve infectivity and help replicate faster. Based on furin cleavage site prediction, the P681R (Delta) as well as P681H (Alpha) changes would improve efficiency of the cut and have more spike processed to S1/S2 cleavage products, which would be expected to increase not only cell entry and infectivity but also increased pathogenesis. Indeed, in recent study where they characterized the impact of the P681R mutation on the S1/S2 cleavage site, the investigators reported that the Delta variant (P681R) showed that the S proteins were highly cleaved (>50%), with a large proportion of cleaved S2 and lower proportion of full-length S detectable than the control original SARS-CoV2 strain, and that P681R alone was sufficient to convey this phenotype, suggesting that P681R is responsible for the enhanced S cleavage in the Delta mutant [116]. A more recent preprint study has also shown that P681R mutation enhances the fitness of the Delta variant over Alpha variant and that the increased cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2 leads to increased infection via cell surface entry [117]. These mechanisms may explain the significant increased transmissibility of the Delta variant with faster replication to reach up to 1,000 fold increase viral load, and shortened incubation period (2-4 days) compared to the original strain. These spike protein processing mechanisms in the virus may be a possible explanation as to why Alpha and Delta variants became dominant strains worldwide. Finally, since increased S1/S2 cleavage would result in increased cleaved products such as shed S1, and since shed S1 carries the superantigen-like motif and prior studies have shown that circulating levels of S1 correlate with disease severity, it is likely that the Delta variant may lead to more severe disease [63, 118]. Our data, together with other recent studies, suggest that spike mutations that can affect the furin cleavage site should be carefully monitored, as these mutations may increase viral fitness, increase infectivity and virulence by increasing the efficacy of furin cleavage..

Overall, our analysis also indicates that the ability of variants to evade mAb or Nb treatment depends on the mutations and on the specific Abs, which may be estimated at least qualitatively by full-atomic models and simulations. This also implies that loss in mAb efficacy to neutralize a given variant may be alleviated by combination treatments consisting of mAbs that bind alternative, non-overlapping epitopes. Combination treatments using Abs that act via different neutralization mechanisms have been pointed to effectively prevent virus mutational escape [3, 12, 119, 120]. Notably, the mutation sites on the Delta variant make no contacts with most of the investigated mAbs, except the mAb LY-CoV555 and the Nbs H11-H4 and Nb20. So, this variant would not be expected to escape all the mAbs, except for these three which we examined more carefully. Our analysis demonstrated that among them Nb20 would not lose its potency, which was also confirmed by ELISA experiments (Figure 4); whereas LY-CoV555 would exhibit a weakening in its neutralization capacity. Notably, a recent study (Motozono et al., 2021) showed that L452R (and Y453F) confer escape from HLA-A24-restricted cellular immunity, which draws attention to the heterogeneous behavior of variants and the necessity of analyzing the interactions with specific proteins or antibodies case by case for each variant. Notably, many structure-based arguments we recently made with regard to the infectivity and neutralization of the Alpha and Beta variants in our recent report [121] are corroborated by structural data in a recent study (Cai et al., 2021), which provides valuable information on the structural properties and antigenic behavior of these two variants (but not the Delta or other variants in Table 1). In the present work, the interactions with an extensive set of mAbs and Nbs other than those reported by Cai et al are investigated; and in addition to results on those two variants, we report major new findings on the Delta variant..

A potential approach to minimize the impact of mAb escape mutations is indeed to develop additional mAbs with epitopes that are highly resistant to viral escape, such as those that include epitopes outside of the RBD and epitopes that are cross-reactive across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, including conserved epitopes with low tolerance for mutation [34, 122]. We have recently described such a mAb [20] that binds the putative superantigenic-like motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike [64]. That particular mAb, 6D3, presents the dual advantage of potentially blocking the S1/S2 cleavage site thus interfering with proteolytic cleavage that is essential for viral entry, in addition to targeting the superantigenic region that may contribute to multisystem inflammatory syndromes in in adults and in children and adolescents with severe COVID-19 [20]. Computational predictions may provide testable hypotheses, such as the optimal dosage of selected mAbs treatments, which may be affected by the mutations. Given the growing access to therapeutic mAbs via clinical trials and emergency use authorization, and the potential emergence of immune evasion mutations that maintain virulence or those that confer resistance to immunizations or therapies [47], this type of in silico assisted genomic/molecular surveillance may provide valuable feedback for accelerating the design of experimental studies in response to the pandemic..

Even though the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 has been slower than those of SARS-CoV from 2003 and other SARS-family coronaviruses, new SARS-CoV-2 variants have been noted to exhibit higher transmissibility and to possibly evade the host immune response. Table 1 lists recent variants, leading to the current surge of the Delta variant as the dominant variant currently (8/2021) observed in the USA, UK, most of the EU, and other countries. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and nanobodies (Nbs) have been shown to neutralize the wild type viral spike proteins, and structural data for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein complexed with those antibodies (Abs) have been reported earlier, which we compiled in Table 2. While some of these Abs have been reported to retain their activity, others exhibit reduced neutralization capacity, and there is a need for a systematic study at the full atomic scale, examining the ability of variants to possible escape those Abs. Equally important is to assess the changes in the interactions of mutant spike glycoproteins with human receptor proteins and other co-factors, relative to those of the wild-type spike..

This study analyzes in silico at the full-atomic scale the impact of recent mutations, and in particular the Beta (South African) and Delta (Indian) variants, on the interactions of the viral spike glycoprotein with its cognate proteins in the host cell, as well as mAbs and Nbs which have been reported to neutralize the wild type virus. In addition to corroborating earlier findings and providing a mechanistic explanation for earlier observations, our study provides new predictions on systems not characterized experimentally. The added value is three-fold: predicting whether specific variants are expected to escape specific Abs; providing a mechanistic explanation for earlier observations as well as new findings such as those experimentally validated here for the nanobody Nb20; and establishing a computational protocol that can be readily applicable to future variants and newly discovered antibodies..

The distinctive behavior of the variants vis-à-vis different types of Abs highlights the significance of carrying out full-atomic structure- and dynamics-dependent studies for assessing the specific response of different Abs to newly emerging variants. The results are particularly significant for the Delta variant, as the corresponding P681R mutation in the spike directly affects a superantigenic region potentially escalating a cytokine storm, and enhancing the occurrence of proteolytic cleavage resulting in an increase in both the fusogenic properties of the spike S2 subunit and the circulation of the shed pathogenic S1 particles in the extracellular medium..

The latter enables a tighter contact resulting in higher binding affinity compared to WT. Here and in all panels spike residues are labelled in boldface, ACE2 residues in plain face, italic. (C) Same as B for the triple mutant K417N, D501Y and E484K. Two potential salt bridges (with ACE2 D30 and K31) formed by K417 and E484, respectively in the wt (top) are broken but replaced by other salt bridges in the South African variant. Residues forming salt bridges are shown as spheres. (D-G) Detailed time evolution of relevant interfacial salt bridges (measured by intermolecular O-N distances) formed between ACE2 and WT S (D-E) and the South African variant (F-G). The salt bridge K417-D30 is persistently maintained by the WT S, while E484-K31 shows very low (0.06) occupancy. In contrast, the mutated residue K484 exhibits a high propensity to form a salt bridge with E75 (F). Its higher occupancy (G), compared to the counterpart (E484-K31) alternatively formed in the WT (E), suggests that the mutation E484K promotes binding to ACE2..

The panels compare the interactions of the mAbs C105 (A-C) and REGN10933 (D-I) with the wt RBD (A and D), the South African variant (Beta; B and E), the Brazilian variant (Gamma; C) and the Indian variant (Delta; F). A central salt bridge with C105 (K417-E99/E96) and another with REGN10933 (K417-D31) are lost due to the substitution K417N. Salt bridge R403-D31 is formed stably in H, which may compensate to restore the binding of REGN10933. N501Y makes no interfacial contacts, and E484K undergoes rearrangements to alleviate the effect of charge change. MD simulations reveal additional interfacial interactions of REGN10933 bound to WT (D and G), SA (E and H) and Delta variant (F and I) RBDs. In the crystal structure of REGN10933 bound to WT RBD (PDB: 6XDG), only one salt bridge K417-D31 was identified. Two additional interfacial salt bridges were revealed by multiple MD simulation runs: E484-R100 and R403-D31.

The mutation sites K417 and N501, and associated ACE2 residues (D30 and K31, forming salt bridges with K417 and E484, respectively) are distinguished as peaks (essential residues). Likewise, L452 is among essential residues (peak). Three RBD residues implicated in the human-to-animal passage of the virus are labeled in cyan, which are also detected as essential residues. (C) ESSA profile for isolated RBD (red curve), compared to its counterpart in the complex (black), shows that K417, N501, and Y505 acquire a significant mechanical role upon complexation, while L452 retains its essential mechanical role in both the isolated and complexed RBD. (D) Position of N501 in the RBD-ACE2 complex. RBD is color-coded by GNM mobility profile (from red; most constrained, to cyan, most mobile). (E) Closeup view of the interfacial regions displaying an allosteric pocket predicted by ESSA (red wire), and key residues in the vicinity..

Countries of origin are listed, but these variants have now been observed in multiple countries [22, 36, 123, 124]. The first four are analyzed in the present study..

Protein Data Bank (PDB) ids of the structure resolved for S (or RBD) complexed with the indicated antibodies (top 14 rows), or with the human receptor ACE2 (second last row). Note that representative structures are shown among those in the PDB. Of the 14 listed antibodies, 12 are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and two (H11-H4 and Nb20) are nanobodies (Nbs). Those mAbs and/or Nbs written in boldface contain mutated residues at their interface with S..
